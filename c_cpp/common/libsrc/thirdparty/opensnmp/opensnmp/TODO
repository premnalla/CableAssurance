- check shutdown, only shutdown extant processes

- Need to change engine ID discovery to only be done within CG, MP
  should no longer handle it (althoughh it should continue to handle
  boots/time synching!)

- Debug as namespace?, i.e. complie time ifdef's to change function
  descriptions to void's. Otherwise use debug class.  Get away from
  namespace munging C++ mismatched Macro's, not that I'm bitter.

- need to try getting rid of ostream in debug (there is an apparent
  threading race condition using string stream stuff causing
  seg-faults, fun)
