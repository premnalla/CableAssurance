The openSNMP package supports SNMPV3 communications. It has been tested on
 several different UNIX platforms (LINUX, SOLARIS, BSD).

For installation instructions and necessary packages, look in INSTALL

This README will cover some issues involved with using this Beta Version:

This engine supports only the SNMP V3 protocol. In order to use this
you will need to have users and access privileges. Currently there is
a script, app/cr/snmp-db-init that is used to add the user
newUser'sinfo neccessary for the tests scripts. It adds newUser to the
USM tables using MD5 authentication (passwd: 'kissthesky'), DES
privacy (passwd: 'zonkerharris'). It exists with the engine ID
'localEngineID' for communicating to the CR and with the engine ID
'0x800007E50454455354' for communicating with the netsnmp test
configuration (./snmpd.conf).

newUser exists in the VACM table with group 'aGroup' with has a view
'testview' with is allowed to see everything under the '.1.3.6.1'
OID tree.

Entering new table values are currently limited to the following:

Persistent data can also be added using some executables in tools/. An
example of this is the shell script app/cr/snmp-db-init. You will need
to know the explicit OID, column number, and values that you want to
exist in order to use this.

For the CG (app/cg/cg), a user'sinfo can be added at the command
line. See 'app/cg/cg --help' for directions.
