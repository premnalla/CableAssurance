	library, with many different ways to accomplish the same
	task. Unfortunately, this means that figuring out how to perform
	a simple task can be frustrating for new users. In this section
	we will provide an overview of the most important user-facing
	components of the library.</p><p>The overall process for using MySQL++ is similar to that of
	most other database access APIs:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Open the connection</p></li><li><p>Form and execute the query</p></li><li><p>Iterate through the result set</p></li><li><p>Go to 2 :)</p></li></ol></div><p>There is, however, a lot of extra functionality along each
	step of the way.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2810080"></a>2.1. The Connection Object</h3></div></div><p>A <tt><a href="../../refman/html/classmysqlpp_1_1Connection.html">Connection</a></tt>
		object manages the connection to the MySQL
		server. You need at least one of these objects to
		do anything. Because the other MySQL++ objects your
		program will use often depend (at least indirectly)
		on the <tt>Connection</tt> instance,
		the <tt>Connection</tt> object needs
		to live at least as long as all other MySQL++ objects
		in your program.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2810115"></a>2.2. The Query Object</h3></div></div><p>Most often, you create SQL queries using a
		<tt><a href="../../refman/html/classmysqlpp_1_1Query.html">Query</a></tt> object created
		by the <tt>Connection</tt> object.</p><p><tt>Query</tt> is subclassed
		from <tt>std::stringstream</tt>
		which means you can write to it like any other
		C++ stream to form a query. The library includes
		<a href="../../refman/html/manip_8h.html" target="_top">stream
		manipulators</a> that make it easy to generate
		syntactically-correct SQL.</p><p>You can also set up <a href="tquery.html">Template Queries</a>
		with this class. Template queries work something
		like C's <tt>printf()</tt> function:
		you set up a fixed query string with tags inside that
		indicate where to insert the variable parts. If you
		have multiple queries that are structurally similar,
		you simply set up one template query, and use that
		in the various locations of your program.</p><p>A third method for building queries is
		to use <tt>Query</tt> with <a href="ssqls.html">Specialized SQL Structures</a> (SSQLS). This feature presents your
		results as a C++ data structure, instead of making
		you access the data through MySQL++ intermediary
		classes. It also reduces the amount of embedded SQL
		code your program needs.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2810327"></a>2.3. Result Sets</h3></div></div><p>The field data in a result set are stored in a
		special <tt>std::string</tt>-like
		class called
		<tt><a href="../../refman/html/classmysqlpp_1_1ColData__Tmpl.html">ColData</a></tt>.
		This class has conversion operators
		that let you automatically convert these
		objects to any of the basic C data types.
		Additionally, MySQL++ defines classes like
		<tt><a href="../../refman/html/structmysqlpp_1_1DateTime.html">DateTime</a></tt>,
		which you can initialize from a MySQL
		<tt>DATETIME</tt> string. These
		automatic conversions are protected against bad
		conversions, and can either set a warning flag or throw an
		exception, depending on how you set the library up.</p><p>As for the result sets as a whole, MySQL++ has a
		number of different ways of representing them:</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2859890"></a>Queries That Do Not Return Data</h4></div></div><p>Not all SQL queries return data. An
			example is <tt>CREATE
			TABLE</tt>. For these
			types of queries, there is a special result type
			(<tt><a href="../../refman/html/classmysqlpp_1_1ResNSel.html">ResNSel</a></tt>)
			that simply reports the
			state resulting from the query: whether the
			query was successful, how many rows it impacted
			(if any), etc.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2859924"></a>Queries That Return Data: Dynamic Method</h4></div></div><p>The easiest way to
			retrieve data from MySQL uses a
			<tt><a href="../../refman/html/classmysqlpp_1_1Result.html">Result</a></tt>
			object, which includes one or more
			<tt><a href="../../refman/html/classmysqlpp_1_1Row.html">Row</a></tt>
			objects. Because these classes are
			<tt>std::vector</tt>-like
			containers, you can treat the result set as a
			two-dimensional array. For example, you can get
			the 5th item on the 2nd row by simply saying
			<tt>result.at(1).at(4)</tt>. You
			can also access row elements
			by field name, like this:
			<tt>result.at(2)[&quot;price&quot;]</tt>.</p><p>An alternate way of accessing
			your query results is through a
			<tt><a href="../../refman/html/classmysqlpp_1_1ResUse.html">ResUse</a></tt>
			object. This class acts more like an STL input
			iterator than a container: you walk through
			your result set one item at a time, always going
			forward. You can't seek around in the result set,
			and you can't know how many results are in the
			set until you find the end. This method is more
			efficient when there can be arbitrarily many
			results, which could pose a memory allocation
			problem with the previous technique.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2860002"></a>Queries That Return Data: Static Method</h4></div></div><p>The <a href="ssqls.html">Specialized SQL Structures</a> (SSQLS) feature
			method above defines C++ structures that match the
			table structures in your database schema.</p><p>We call it the &quot;static&quot; method because the
			table structure is fixed at compile time. Indeed,
			some schema changes require that you update your
			SSQLS definitions and recompile, or else the
			program could crash or throw &quot;bad conversion&quot;
			exceptions when MySQL++ tries to stuff the new
			data into an outdated data structure.  (Not all
			changes require a recompile. Adding a column to
			a table is safe, for instance, as the program
			will ignore the new column until you update the
			SSQLS definition.)</p><p>The advantage of this method is that
			your program will require very little embedded
			SQL code. You can simply execute a query, and
			receive your results as C++ data structures,
			which can be accessed just as you would any
			other structure. The results can be accessed
			through the Row object, or you can ask the
			library to dump the results into a sequential
			or set-associative STL container for you. Consider
			this:</p><pre class="programlisting">
vector&lt;mystruct&gt; v;
Query q = connection.query();
q &lt;&lt; &quot;SELECT * FROM mytable&quot;;
q.storein(v);
for (vector&lt;mystruct&gt;::iterator it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it) {
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Price: &quot; &lt;&lt; it-&gt;price &lt;&lt; endl;
}</pre><p>Isn't that slick?</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2860065"></a>2.4. Exceptions</h3></div></div><p>By default, the library throws  <a href="tutorial.html#exceptions">exceptions</a> whenever it encounters an
		error. You can ask the library to set an error flag
		instead, if you like, but the exceptions carry more
		information. Not only do they include a string
		member telling you why the exception was thrown,
		there are several exception types, so you can
		distinguish between different error types within a
		single <tt>try</tt>
		block.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="index.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="tutorial.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">MySQL++ User Manual </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> 3. Tutorial</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
