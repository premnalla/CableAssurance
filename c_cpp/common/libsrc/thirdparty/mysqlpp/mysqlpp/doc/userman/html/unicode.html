		dealt with 8-bit character sets. This only gives you 256
		possible characters, but the modern Western languages have
		more characters combined than that by themselves. Add in
		all the other lanauges of the world, plus the various
		symbols people use, and you have a real mess! Since no
		standards body held sway over things like international
		character encoding in the early days of computing, many
		different character sets were invented. These character
		sets weren't even standardized between operating systems,
		so heaven help you if you needed to move localized Greek
		text on a Windows machine to a Russian Macintosh! The only
		way we got any international communication done at all
		was to build standards on the common 7-bit ASCII subset.
		Either people used approximations like a plain &quot;c&quot; instead
		of the French &quot;ç&quot;, or they invented things like
		HTML entities (&quot;&amp;ccedil;&quot; in this case) to encode
		these additional characters using only 7-bit ASCII.</p><p>Unicode solves this problem. It encodes every
		character in the world, using up to 4 bytes per
		character. The subset covering the most economically
		valuable cases takes two bytes per character, so most
		Unicode-aware programs deal in 2-byte characters,
		for efficiency.</p><p>Unfortunately, Unicode came about two
		decades too late for Unix and C. Converting the
		Unix system call interface to use multi-byte
		Unicode characters would break all existing
		programs. The ISO lashed a wide character <a href="http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/s/sidecar.html" target="_top">sidecar</a>
		onto C in 1995, but in common practice C is still
		tied to 8-bit characters.</p><p>As Unicode began to take off in the early 1990s,
		it became clear that some sort of accommodation
		with Unicode was needed in legacy systems like
		Unix and C. During the development of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs" target="_top">Plan
		9</a> operating system (a kind
		of successor to Unix) Ken Thompson <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/utf-8-history.txt" target="_top">invented</a>
		the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8" target="_top">UTF-8
		encoding</a>. UTF-8 is a superset of 7-bit ASCII
		and is compatible with C strings, since it doesn't use 0
		bytes anywhere as multi-byte Unicode encodings do. As a
		result, many programs that deal in text will cope with
		UTF-8 data even though they have no explicit support
		for UTF-8. (Follow the last link above to see how the
		design of UTF-8 allows this.)</p><p>The MySQL database server comes out of the
		Unix/C tradition, so it only supports 8-bit characters
		natively. All versions of MySQL could store UTF-8 data,
		but sometimes the server actually needs to understand
		the data; when sorting, for instance. To support this,
		explicit UTF-8 support was added to MySQL in version
		4.1.</p><p>Because MySQL++ does not need to
		understand the text flowing through it, it
		neither has nor needs explicit UTF-8 support.
		C++'s <tt>std::string</tt>
		stores UTF-8 data just fine. But, your program probably
		<span class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> care about the text it gets
		from the database via MySQL++. The remainder of this
		chapter covers the choices you have for dealing with
		UTF-8 encoded Unicode data in your program.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2876084"></a>6.2. Unicode and Unix</h3></div></div><p>Modern Unices support UTF-8 natively. Red Hat Linux,
		for instance, has had system-wide UTF-8 support since
		version 8. This continues in the Enterprise and Fedora
		forks of Red Hat Linux, of course.</p><p>On such a Unix, the terminal I/O code understands
		UTF-8 encoded data, so your program doesn't require any
		special code to correctly display a UTF-8 string. If you
		aren't sure whether your system supports UTF-8 natively,
		just run the simple1 example: if the first item has
		two high-ASCII characters in place of the &quot;ü&quot; in
		&quot;Nürnberger Brats&quot;, you know it's not handling
		UTF-8.</p><p>If your Unix doesn't support UTF-8 natively,
		it likely doesn't support any form of Unicode at all,
		for the historical reasons I gave above. Therefore,
		you will have to convert the UTF-8 data to the
		local 8-bit character set. The standard Unix
		function <tt>iconv()</tt>
		can help here. If your system doesn't have the
		<tt>iconv()</tt> facility, there
		is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/" target="_top">a
		free implementation</a> available from the GNU
		Project. Another library you might check out is IBM's
		<a href="http://icu.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">ICU</a>. This
		is rather heavy-weight, so if you just need basic
		conversions, <tt>iconv()</tt>
		should suffice.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2876164"></a>6.3. Unicode and Win32</h3></div></div><p>Each Win32 API function that takes
		a string actually has two two versions. One
		version supports only 1-byte &quot;ANSI&quot; characters (a
		superset of ASCII), so they end in 'A'. Win32 also
		supports the 2-byte subset of Unicode called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCS-2" target="_top">UCS-2</a>.
		Some call these &quot;wide&quot; characters, so the other
		set of functions end in 'W'. The <tt><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/windowing/dialogboxes/dialogboxreference/dialogboxfunctions/messagebox.asp" target="_top">MessageBox</a>()</tt>
		API, for instance, is actually a macro,
		not a real function. If you define the
		<tt>UNICODE</tt>
		macro when building your program, the
		<tt>MessageBox()</tt>
		macro evaluates to
		<tt>MessageBoxW()</tt>; otherwise,
		to <tt>MessageBoxA()</tt>.</p><p>Since MySQL uses UTF-8 and Win32 uses UCS-2,
		you must convert data going between the Win32
		API and MySQL++. Since there's no point in trying
		for portability &#8212; no other OS I'm aware of
		uses UCS-2 &#8212; you might as well use native
		Win32 functions for doing this translation. The following code
		is distilled from <tt>utf8_to_win32_ansi()</tt>
		in <tt>examples/util.cpp</tt>:</p><pre class="programlisting">
void utf8_to_win32_ansi(const char* utf8_str, char* ansi_str, int ansi_len)
{
    wchar_t ucs2_buf[100];
    static const int ub_chars = sizeof(ucs2_buf) / sizeof(ucs2_buf[0]);

    MultiByteToWideChar(CP_UTF8, 0, utf8_str, -1, ucs2_buf, ub_chars);
    CPINFOEX cpi;
    GetCPInfoEx(CP_OEMCP, 0, &amp;cpi);
    WideCharToMultiByte(cpi.CodePage, 0, ucs2_buf, -1,
            ansi_str, ansi_len, 0, 0);
}</pre><p>The examples use this function automatically on
		Windows systems. To see it in action, run simple1 in
		a console window (a.k.a. &quot;DOS box&quot;). The first item
		should be &quot;Nürnberger Brats&quot;. If not, see the
		last paragraph in this section.</p><p><tt>utf8_to_win32_ansi()</tt>
		converts <tt>utf8_str</tt>
		from UTF-8 to UCS-2, and from there to the local <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/intl/unicode_81rn.asp" target="_top">code
		page</a>. &quot;Waitaminnit,&quot; you shout! &quot;I thought we
		were trying to get away from the problem of local code
		pages!&quot; The console is one of the few Win32 facilities
		that doesn't support UCS-2 by default. It can be <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/win32-console" target="_top">put
		into UCS-2 mode</a>, but that seems like more
		work than we'd like to go to in a portable example
		program.  Since the default code page in most versions
		of Windows includes the &quot;ü&quot; character used in the
		sample database, this conversion works out fine for our
		purposes.</p><p>If your program is using the GUI to display
		text, you don't need the second conversion. Prove
		this to yourself by adding the following to
		<tt>utf8_to_win32_ansi()</tt>
		after the
		<tt>MultiByteToWideChar()</tt>
		call:</p><pre class="programlisting">
MessageBox(0, ucs2_buf, &quot;UCS-2 version of Item&quot;, MB_OK);</pre><p>All of this assumes you're using Windows NT
		or one of its direct descendants: Windows 2000,
		Windows XP, Windows 2003 Server, and someday Windows
		Vista. Windows 95/98/ME and Windows CE do not support
		UCS-2. They still have the 'W' APIs for compatibility,
		but they just smash the data down to 8-bit and call
		the 'A' version for you.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2876367"></a>6.4. For More Information</h3></div></div><p>The <a href="http://www.unicode.org/faq/" target="_top">Unicode
