	the epochal 1.7.9 release that break end-user programs. You
	can dig this stuff out of the ChangeLog, but the ChangeLog
	focuses more on explaining and justifying the facets of each
	change, while this section focuses on how to migrate your
	code between these library versions.</p><p>Since pure additions do not break programs, those
	changes are still documented only in the ChangeLog.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2876430"></a>7.1. API Changes</h3></div></div><p>This section documents files, functions,
		methods and classes that were removed or changed
		in an incompatible way. If your program uses the
		changed item, you will have to change something in
		your program to get it to compile after upgrading to
		each of these versions.</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2876446"></a>v1.7.10</h4></div></div><p>Removed
			<tt>Row::operator[]()</tt>
			overloads except the one for
			<tt>size_type</tt>,
			and added
			<tt>Row::lookup_by_name()</tt>
			to provide the &quot;subscript by
			string&quot; functionality.	In practical
			terms, this change means that the
			<tt>row[&quot;field&quot;]</tt>
			syntax no longer works; you must use the new
			<tt>lookup_by_name</tt>
			method instead.</p><p>Renamed the generated
			library on POSIX systems from
			<tt>libsqlplus</tt> to
			<tt>libmysqlpp</tt>.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2876517"></a>v1.7.19</h4></div></div><p>Removed
			<tt>SQLQuery::operator=()</tt>,
			and the same for its
			<tt>Query</tt>
			subclass. Use the copy constructor instead, if you need to copy
			one query to another query object.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2876546"></a>v1.7.20</h4></div></div><p>The library used to have two names for
			many core classes: a short one, such as
			<tt>Row</tt>
			and a longer one,
			<tt>MysqlRow</tt>. The
			library now uses the shorter names
			exclusively.</p><p>All symbols within MySQL++ are in the
			<tt>mysqlpp</tt>
			namespace now if you use the new
			<tt>mysql++.h</tt>
			header. If you use the older
			<tt>sqlplus.hh</tt>
			or <tt>mysql++.hh</tt>
			headers, these symbols are hoist up into the
			global namespace. The older headers cause the
			compiler to emit warnings if you use them,
			and they will go away someday.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2876612"></a>v2.0.0</h4></div></div><div class="sect4" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h5 class="title"><a name="id2876619"></a>Connection class changes</h5></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><tt>Connection::create_db()</tt>
					and
					<tt>drop_db()</tt>
					return
					<tt>true</tt>
					on success. They returned
					<tt>false</tt>
					in v1.7.<span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>!
					This change will only
					affect your code if
					you have exceptions
					disabled.</p></li><li><p>Renamed
					<tt>Connection::real_connect()</tt>
					to
					<tt>connect()</tt>,
					made several more
					of its parameters
					default, and removed the old
					<tt>connect()</tt>
					method, as it's now a strict
					subset of the new one. The
					only practical consequence is
					that if your program was using
					<tt>real_connect()</tt>,
					you will have to change it to
					<tt>connect()</tt>.</p></li><li><p>Replaced
					<tt>Connection::read_option()</tt>
					with new
					<tt>set_option()</tt>
					mechanism. In addition
					to changing the name,
					programs using this function
					will have to use the new
					<tt>Connection::Option</tt>
					enumerated values, accept a
					<tt>true</tt>
					return value as meaning
					success instead of 0, and
					use the proper argument
					type. Regarding the latter,
					<tt>read_option()</tt>
					took a <tt>const
					char*</tt>
					argument, but because it was
					just a thin wrapper over
					the MySQL C API function
					<tt><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/mysql-options.html">mysql_options()</a></tt>, the actual
					value being pointed to could
					be any of several types. This
					new mechanism is properly
					type-safe.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect4" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h5 class="title"><a name="id2876785"></a>Exception-related changes</h5></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Classes
					<tt>Connection</tt>,
					<tt>Query</tt>,
					<tt>Result</tt>,
					<tt>ResUse</tt>,
					and
					<tt>Row</tt>
					now derive from
					<tt><a href="../../refman/html/classmysqlpp_1_1OptionalExceptions.html">OptionalExceptions</a></tt>
					which gives these classes a
					common interface for disabling
					exceptions. In addition,
					almost all of the per-method
					exception-disabling flags were
					removed. The preferred method
					for disabling exceptions on
					these objects is to create
					an instance of the new
					<tt><a href="../../refman/html/classmysqlpp_1_1NoExceptions.html">NoExceptions</a></tt>
					class on the stack, which
					disables exceptions on an
					<tt>OptionalExceptions</tt>
					subclass as long as the
					<tt>NoExceptions</tt>
					instance is in
					scope. You can instead call
					<tt>disable_exceptions()</tt>
					on any of these objects,
					but if you only want them
					disabled temporarily, it's
					easy to forget to re-enable
					them later.</p></li><li><p>In the
					previous version of MySQL++,
					those classes that supported
					optional exceptions that
					could create instances of
					other such classes were
					supposed to pass this flag
					on to their children. That
					is, if you created a
					<tt>Connection</tt>
					object with exceptions enabled,
					and then asked it to create a
					<tt>Query</tt>
					object, the
					<tt>Query</tt>
					object also had exceptions
					disabled. The problem is, this
					didn't happen in all cases
					where it should have in v1.7.
					This bug is fixed in v2.0. If
					your program begins crashing
					due to uncaught exceptions
					after upgrading to v2.0, this
					is the most likely cause. The
					most expeditious fix in this
					situation is to use the new
					<tt>NoExceptions</tt>
					feature to return these
					code paths to the v1.7
					behavior. A better fix is
					to rework your program to
					avoid or deal with the new
					exceptions.</p></li><li><p>All
					custom MySQL++ exceptions
					now derive from the new
					<tt><a href="../../refman/html/classmysqlpp_1_1Exception.html">Exception</a></tt>
					interface.  The practical
					upshot of this is that the
					variability between the
					various exception types has
					been eliminated. For instance,
					to get the error string, the
					<tt>BadQuery</tt>
					exception had a
					string member called
					<tt>error</tt>
					plus a method called
					<tt>what()</tt>.
					Both did the
					same thing, and the
					<tt>what()</tt>
					method is more common, so the
					error string was dropped from
					the interface. None of the
					example programs had to be
					changed to work with the new
					exceptions, so if your program
					handles MySQL++ exceptions
					the same way they do, your
					program won't need to change,
					either.</p></li><li><p>Renamed
					<tt>SQLQueryNEParams</tt>
					exception to
					<tt>BadParamCount</tt>
					to match style of other
					exception names.</p></li><li><p>Added
					<tt><a href="../../refman/html/classmysqlpp_1_1BadOption.html">BadOption</a></tt>,
					<tt><a href="../../refman/html/classmysqlpp_1_1ConnectionFailed.html">ConnectionFailed</a></tt>,
					<tt><a href="../../refman/html/classmysqlpp_1_1DBSelectionFailed.html">DBSelectionFailed</a></tt>,
					<tt><a href="../../refman/html/classmysqlpp_1_1EndOfResults.html">EndOfResults</a></tt>,
					<tt><a href="../../refman/html/classmysqlpp_1_1EndOfResultSets.html">EndOfResultSets</a></tt>,
					<tt><a href="../../refman/html/classmysqlpp_1_1LockFailed.html">LockFailed</a></tt>, and
					<tt><a href="../../refman/html/classmysqlpp_1_1ObjectNotInitialized.html">ObjectNotInitialized</a></tt>
					exception types,
					to fix overuse of
					<tt>BadQuery</tt>.
					Now the latter is used
					only for errors on query
					execution. If your program has
					a &quot;catch-all&quot; block taking a
					<tt>std::exception</tt>
					for each try block containing
					MySQL++ statements, you
					probably won't need to change
					your program. Otherwise,
					the new exceptions will
					likely show up as program
					crashes due to unhandled
					exceptions.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect4" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h5 class="title"><a name="id2877096"></a>Query class changes</h5></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>In

					<tt>bool</tt>.
