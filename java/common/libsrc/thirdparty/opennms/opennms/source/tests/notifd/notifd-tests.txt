Normally a page-email-pemail would be sent, but the users are set up only with emails. The notifd-user10 user
has a duty schedule of Sa600-630 and should not be notified (unless you are running this test between 6am and 6:30
on a Saturday morning).

[ ] All emails from the notifd account are deleted
[ ] Eventd and Notifd are running

Be sure each of the following conditions are true after the test has been run.
[ ] Three emails, one to each member of the Network/Systems group has been recieved. They should all
    be very close in their respective send times.
    [ ] email to notifd-user1 stating that FTP on 192.168.0.189 is down
    [ ] email to notifd-user2 stating that FTP on 192.168.0.189 is down
    [ ] email to notifd-user3 stating that FTP on 192.168.0.189 is down
    [ ] no email received for notifd-user10

    user received escalation email.
