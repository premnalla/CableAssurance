Post-Installation Tasks

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
System Limits -- Mac OS X 10.2 and Lower
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On MacOSX 10.2 and lower, to be able to give PostgreSQL enough buffers and
such to run properly, you will need to change the shared memory buffers in
the startup item:

  /System/Library/StartupItems/SystemTuning/SystemTuning

On our test system we multiplied the supplied values by 4 and all seems to
run OK.  Just look for the sysctl lines near the bottom and set them to:

  sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=65536
  sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmmax=16777216
  sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmmin=1
  sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmmni=128
  sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmseg=32
  sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmall=4096

Be warned, these settings can get changed back on OS upgrade!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
System Limits -- Mac OS X 10.3 and Higher
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On recent versions of Mac OS X, these settings are now in:

  /etc/rc

You should probably do something similar to the limits above (multiply by 4
and reboot) for OpenNMS to run properly, although it seems to work out of the
box on a reasonably full class-C network with recent Fink packages.  Your
mileage may vary, you may need to raise them higher, depending on how large
your network is.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PostgreSQL Limits -- All Platforms
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you do that, you will need to edit
@PREFIX@/var/postgresql-7.4/data/postgresql.conf (as root, or postgres), and
make sure that the following values are set:

  tcpip_socket    = true
  max_connections = 192
  shared_buffers  = 384

Again, on a reasonably small network, the defaults from Fink seem to work
alright now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Database Setup -- All Platforms
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure PostgreSQL is started before you install.  If it isn't, you will
have to start it ("sudo @PREFIX@/bin/pgsql.sh start") and try again.  To run
the installer manually, run:

  sudo @PREFIX@/var/opennms/bin/install -disU

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Startup
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you're ready to start everything up!  Check the configuration files
in @PREFIX@/var/opennms/etc and set them up for your network (as per the
quick start guide at http://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=4141) and run:

  sudo @PREFIX@/bin/pgsql.sh start
  sudo @PREFIX@/bin/opennms start
  sudo @PREFIX@/bin/tomcat4 start
