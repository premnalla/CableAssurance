/**
 * <P>
 * The NetworkInterface class is designed to be a well defined front for passing
 * interfaces to a service monitor. There are many different types of network in
 * use today including IPv4, IPv6, IPX, and others. To accomidate the possible
 * differences this class provides the basic information that a monitor can use
 * to determine the type of interface and its expected address type.
 * </P>
 * 
 * <P>
 * In addition to providing typing and address information, the interface allows
 * for the monitor to associate key-value pairs with an interface. This can be
 * used to save state information between the various invocations if neccessary.
 * The attributes may be shared with other monitors concurrently, so a monitor
 * must be careful to choose unique keys to prevent namespace collisions.
 * </P>
