/**
 * <p>
 * This class is designed to be a single point of reciept for all ICMP messages
 * received by an {@link org.opennms.protocols.icmp.IcmpSocketIcmpSocket}
 * instance. The class implements the
 * {@link org.opennms.core.fiber.PausableFiber PausableFiber}interface as a
 * means to control the operation of the receiver.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Once the receiver is started it will process all recieved datagrams and
 * filter them based upon their ICMP code and the filter identifier used to
 * construct the reciever. All ICMP messages, except for Echo Replies, are
 * discared by the reciever. In addition, only those echo replies that have
 * their identifier set to the passed filter identifier are also discarded.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Received datagrams that pass the requirement of the receiver are added to the
 * reply queue for processing by the application. Only instances of the
 * {@link Reply Reply}class are added to the queue for processing.
