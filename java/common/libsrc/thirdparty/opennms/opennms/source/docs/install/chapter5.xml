  <title>Building From Source</title>

  <section>
    <title>Are you sure you want to do this?</title>

    <para>OpenNMS is a complex software product, and it does not (yet) have a
    simple "<code>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code>"
    build process like many other tools. If there is a packaged release for
    your operating system, we highly suggest you use that instead. If you have
    problems with a packaged release, please see the troubleshooting section
    for assistance.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Install prerequisite applications</title>

    <para>See the chaper on installing prerequisites for OpenNMS and install
    all prerequisites.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Download source</title>

    <para>You can download source for a specific release, or you can download
    source directly from the source code respository (CVS). You probably want
    to download released source unless you wish to do development or are
    looking for specific features or bug fixes that are not yet in a
    release.</para>

    <note>
      <para>The commands listed below can be executed as any user, but they
      will all need to be executed as the same user.</para>
    </note>

    <section>
      <title>Retrieve released source</title>

      <note>
	<para>The <filename>tar</filename> that ships with Solaris will not
	  properly unarchive the OpenNMS source.  It can (nearly) silently fail,
	  leaving you with a corrupted directory of OpenNMS source.  You will
	  need to use GNU tar on Solaris.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Download the latest source release from the <ulink
      url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4141&amp;package_id=118141"><filename>opennms-source</filename>
      file package</ulink> in the <ulink
      url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=4141">OpenNMS
      files section at SourceForge</ulink>. The file name of the source
      release will look something like
      <filename>opennms-source-@product.version@-@product.release@.tar.gz</filename>.
      After you unarchive the source distribution, change directory into
      <filename>opennms-@product.version@-@product.release@/source</filename>
      and continue to the next section.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Retrieve source from CVS</title>

      <para>The source code for OpenNMS is stored in CVS at <ulink
      url="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge.net</ulink>. See the <ulink
      url="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=4141">OpenNMS CVS page</ulink>
      for details, or follow the instructions below to get started
      quickly.</para>

      <para>Login to the CVS server with an empty password:</para>

      <para><programlisting><computeroutput>$ </computeroutput><command>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/opennms login</command></programlisting></para>

      <para>Check out the OpenNMS sources (this will fetch
      <function>HEAD</function>, the most bleeding-edge version):</para>

      <para><programlisting><computeroutput>$ </computeroutput><command>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/opennms co opennms</command></programlisting></para>

      <para>You will now have a directory called <filename>opennms</filename>.
      Change into this directory and continue to the next section.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Configuring <filename>build.properties</filename></title>

    <para>There are a few details about where RRDtool and PostgreSQL are
    installed that the build process cannot (or does not yet) reliably
    determine automatically. If you don't have RRDtool installed into
    <filename>/usr</filename> or if the PostgreSQL server include directory is
    not <filename>/usr/include/pgsql/server</filename>, you will need to
    create a <filename>build.properties</filename> file.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Compiling the RRDtool code is not optional at this time.  Even
      if you plan to to use JRobin, the RRDtool code cannot easily be
      excluded from the build process, so you will need to have RRDtool
      installed.  Enhancement bug 1335 plans to make this RRDtool requirement
      optional.</para>
    </note>

    <para>You can be lazy and let the build process tell you if it cannot find
    any of these components.</para>

    <para>By default, the install process will install OpenNMS into the
    <filename>dist</filename> directory under the same directory that contains
    <filename>build.xml</filename>. This is fine for testing (and probably
    desireable), but if you want to install into somewhere for production use,
    you need to set <filename>install.dir</filename>. You probably want to add
    a line like this to <filename>build.properties</filename>:</para>

    <para><programlisting>install.dir=/opt/OpenNMS</programlisting></para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Compiling OpenNMS</title>

    <para>This part is easy. Execute this command:</para>

    <para><programlisting><computeroutput>$ </computeroutput><command>sh build.sh compile</command></programlisting></para>
