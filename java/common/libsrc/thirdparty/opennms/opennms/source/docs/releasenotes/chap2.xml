  <subtitle>Changes in This OpenNMS</subtitle>

  <para>OpenNMS 1.2.7 is the most recent production, or "stable", release. It
  is the eighth release in the stable branch of OpenNMS. Changes to the stable
  branch are limited to bug fixes and simple improvements. The 1.3 tree is a
  development, or "unstable" tree, where most new features are implemented,
  but without the testing that goes into 1.2. When 1.3 is mature enough, it
  will become OpenNMS 1.4, the next stable version.</para>

      <bridgehead>SNMP "select" Data Collection Reset</bridgehead>

      <para>It turns out this issue, while fixed in 1.2.6, was still present
      if using "SNMPv1" and "SNMPv2" services versus the default "SNMP"
      service. This has been corrected.</para>

      <title>New Features</title>

      <bridgehead>New format for availability reports</bridgehead>

      <para>Version 1.2.6 previews new format availability reports from the
      1.3 tree of OpenNMS. Each availability report format (HTML, PDF and SVG)
      now has a new version of the Last Months Daily Availability and Month to
      Date Daily Availability report. These new reports have a tabular
      calendar look to them and have colour-coded cells to identify days that
      have fallen below "normal" and "warning" levels for the category
      displayed in the report. To generate these reports, select "Calendar
      Format" from the availability reports page in the WebUI. The original
      reports are still available (by default) as "Classic Format"
      reports.</para>

      <bridgehead>Ability to have SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 as Separate
      Services</bridgehead>

      <para>A lot of changes have been made to SNMP. The most useful is the
      ability to view SNMP services by version, instead of as a generic "SNMP"
      service. This is in preparation for the SNMPv3 support that is available
      in the development branch - it would be nice to know which versions of
      SNMP are supported on a device.</para>

      <para>In order to speed up collectd startup times, since 1.2.5 OpenNMS
      has defaulted to SNMPv1 if SNMPv2 was not specifically defined in
      snmp-config.xml. This allows collectd to start without having to query
      each device, but it created a number of issues at sites where the high
      capacity (64-bit) counters were being used to track traffic data. By
      defaulting to SNMPv1, those values were not accessible. Also, there is
      an existing bug where if SNMPv2 was supported without SNMPv1, the
      service would not be discovered (unless v2 was forced in the
      configuration file).</para>

      <para>The approach taken to fix this was to create in capsd two new
      services, SNMPv1 and SNMPv2. By using the "force version" parameter,
      OpenNMS can discover which devices expressly support each version. Armed
      with that information, it should be possible to perform data collection
      using the most preferable version. However, there was the additional
      problem with devices that support both versions - how to prevent double
      collection?</para>

      <para>The solution was to be able to use OpenNMS packages - one for
      SNMPv2 and one for SNMPv1. In any filter or rule, using
      "is[ServiceName]" will return all the IP addresses that support a
      particular service. Thus "isHTTP" will return all those interfaces with
      HTTP running on port 80, and "isSNMPv2" can return all of the devices
      that support SNMP version 2.</para>

      <para>The problem is that having a package for "isSNMPv2" and another
      for "isSNMPv1" would result in duplicate collection on devices that
      supported both. There needed to be some way to say "return all the
      interfaces that support SNMPv1 but do not support SNMPv2". Using
      something like "!(isSNMPv2)" didn't work because that is true for any
      service that is not SNMPv2, instead of finding out "is SNMPv2 one of the
      supported services".</para>

      <para>The solution was to create a new filter tool called
      "notis[ServiceName]". This will craft an SQL query such that it will
      only return true if "ServiceName" is not associated with the interface
      in question. The final piece was to add a "force version" parameter to
      collectd. Now it was possible to create two packages, one for SNMPv2 and
      one for SNMPv1, that would collect as desired.</para>

      <para>There are only two steps needed to get this working. First, the
      two services must be added to the capsd-configuration.xml.</para>

      <para><programlisting><code> </code>        &lt;protocol-plugin protocol="SNMPv1" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.capsd.SnmpPlugin" scan="on" user-defined="false"&gt;
                &lt;property key="timeout" value="2000"/&gt;
                &lt;property key="force version" value="v1"/&gt;
                &lt;property key="retry" value="2"/&gt;
        &lt;/protocol-plugin&gt;
        &lt;protocol-plugin protocol="SNMPv2" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.capsd.SnmpPlugin" scan="on" user-defined="false"&gt;
                &lt;property key="timeout" value="2000"/&gt;
                &lt;property key="force version" value="v2c"/&gt;
                &lt;property key="retry" value="2"/&gt;
        &lt;/protocol-plugin&gt;</programlisting></para>

      <para>Now this is the important part - before switching over to using
      the new services, they have to be discovered on the devices. This takes
      time. If the default rescan frequency is being used, then at least 24
      hours is needed until SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 will be discovered.</para>

      <para>If you know your network, then some SQL trickery can be used to
      make this easier. First, update capsd as above and restart
      OpenNMS.</para>

      <para>Get in to the database: <code></code></para>

      <para><code>psql -U opennms opennms</code> and then <code>select * from
      service;</code></para>

      <para>Note the serviceIDs for SNMP, SNMPv1 and SNMPv2.</para>

      <para>To add SNMPv1 to those devices that already have SNMP, use the
      following SQL: <code></code></para>

      <para><code>INSERT INTO ifservices (nodeid, ipaddr, ifindex, serviceid,
      status, source, notify) SELECT nodeid, ipaddr, ifindex, [SNMPv1 ID],
      status, source, notify FROM ifservices WHERE serviceid=[SNMP ID] AND
      ipaddr NOT IN (SELECT ipaddr FROM ifservices WHERE serviceid=[SNMPv1
      ID]);</code></para>

      <para>replacing [SNMP ID] with the serviceID for SNMP and [SNMPv1 ID]
      with the serviceID for SNMPv1. Repeat as desired for SNMPv2.</para>

      <para>Second, the <filename>collectd-configuration.xml</filename> file
      must be updated. Remember - only do this if SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 have been
      discovered.</para>

      <para><programlisting><code>        &lt;package name="collect-SNMPv2"&gt;
                &lt;filter&gt;isSNMPv2&lt;/filter&gt;
                &lt;include-range begin="1.1.1.1" end="254.254.254.254"/&gt;

                &lt;service name="SNMPv2" interval="300000" user-defined="false" status="on"&gt;
                        &lt;parameter key="collection" value="default"/&gt;
                        &lt;parameter key="force version" value="v2c"/&gt;
                        &lt;parameter key="port" value="161"/&gt;
                        &lt;parameter key="retry" value="3"/&gt;
                        &lt;parameter key="timeout" value="3000"/&gt;
                &lt;/service&gt;

                &lt;outage-calendar&gt;zzz from poll-outages.xml zzz&lt;/outage-calendar&gt;
        &lt;/package&gt;

        &lt;package name="collect-SNMPv1"&gt;
                &lt;filter&gt;isSNMPv1 &amp;amp; notisSNMPv2&lt;/filter&gt;
                &lt;include-range begin="1.1.1.1" end="254.254.254.254"/&gt;

                &lt;service name="SNMPv1" interval="300000" user-defined="false" status="on"&gt;
                        &lt;parameter key="collection" value="default"/&gt;

                        &lt;parameter key="timeout" value="3000"/&gt;
                &lt;/service&gt;

                &lt;outage-calendar&gt;zzz from poll-outages.xml zzz&lt;/outage-calendar&gt;
        &lt;/package&gt;

        &lt;collector service="SNMPv1"     class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.collectd.SnmpCollector"/&gt;
        &lt;collector service="SNMPv2"     class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.collectd.SnmpCollector"/&gt;
</code></programlisting></para>

      <para>Note the use of the "notis" filter tool to only do collection via
      SNMPv1 if SNMPv2 is not present.</para>

      <bridgehead>New JDBCStoredProcedureMonitor and
      JDBCStoredProcedurePlugin</bridgehead>

      <para>Tobey Pasheilich has added some new functionality to the JDBC
      monitoring code in OpenNMS.</para>

      <para>In his environment, Oracle backups take their database(s)
      off-line. However, Oracle still responds to connections and the metadata
      poll as performed in JDBCMonitor passes even though the databases are
      not available. These changes allow testing via the execution of a stored
      procedure to insure that the database is actually working. This may also
      allow some application level rules to be evaluated.</para>

      <para>Usage is typical of other plugins and pollers. Entries must be
      created for the new java plugins. As an extension of the
      <filename>JDBCPlugin</filename> and <filename>JDBCMonitor</filename>, it
      requires all the xml parameters those classes require. Additionally, a
      parameter <filename>'stored-procedure'</filename> is required. The
      procedure name given in the xml is assumed to exist inside a package
      named <filename>'test'</filename> on the database. It is hoped that this
      will help limit concerns about accidental stored procedure invokation.
      The stored procedure must return a bit and take no arguements.</para>

      <para>An example <filename>capsd-configuration.xml</filename> entry
      would be something like:</para>

      <para><programlisting>&lt;protocol-plugin protocol="Oracle-JDBC-ets" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.capsd.JDBCStoredProcedurePlugin" scan="on" user-defined="false"&gt;
       &lt;property key="user" value="USERNAME"/&gt;
       &lt;property key="password" value="PASSWORD"/&gt;
       &lt;property key="retry" value="2"/&gt;
       &lt;property key="timeout" value="3000"/&gt;
       &lt;property key="driver" value="oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver"/&gt;
       &lt;property key="url" value="jdbc:oracle:thin:@OPENNMS_JDBC_HOSTNAME:1521:ets"/&gt;
       &lt;property key="stored-procedure" value="ets"/&gt;
   &lt;/protocol-plugin&gt;</programlisting></para>

      <para>And in <filename>poller-configuration.xml</filename> add:</para>

      <para><programlisting>       &lt;service name="Oracle-JDBC-ets" interval="300000" user-defined="false" status="on"&gt;
           &lt;parameter key="user" value="USERNAME"/&gt;
           &lt;parameter key="password" value="PASSWORD"/&gt;
           &lt;parameter key="timeout" value="3000"/&gt;
           &lt;parameter key="driver" value="oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver"/&gt;
           &lt;parameter key="url" value="jdbc:oracle:thin:@OPENNMS_JDBC_HOSTNAME:1521:ets"/&gt;
           &lt;parameter key="stored-procedure" value="ets"/&gt;
           &lt;parameter key="rrd-repository" value="/usr/local/opennms/share/rrd/response"/&gt;
           &lt;parameter key="ds-name" value="jdbc-ets"/&gt;
       &lt;/service&gt;</programlisting></para>

      <para>Remember to add the service definition at the bottom:</para>

      <para><programlisting>&lt;monitor service="Oracle-JDBC-ets" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.poller.monitors.JDBCStoredProcedureMonitor"/&gt;</programlisting></para>

      <bridgehead>Capsd SNMP Plugin and Poller SNMP Monitor Changed
      Slightly</bridgehead>

      <para>In addition to changes for the new SNMP services, the SNMP plugin
      and SNMP monitor where changed to use SNMP GET commands instead of SNMP
      GETNEXT commands. This will make it easier to build SNMP-based monitors,
      as the discovery of the SNMP-based service will be more accurate.</para>

      <bridgehead>WebUI Speed Enhancements</bridgehead>

      <para>On large systems the OpenNMS GUI can become slow. In an attempt to
      fix that, most of the Admin functions for the system are also available
      under the Admin section for each node. This saves time waiting for the
      large system-wide pages to load. However, the "Configure SNMP Data
      Collection per Interface" would always return to the system-wide page
      after a change. Now it will return to the page for the node. Also, the
      "List Nodes" page will only list the node labels instead of the node
      labels and interfaces (that option is still available under "Search").
      Also on that topic, the Manage/Unmanage screen no longer requires a
      restart (I should be hearing a collective cheer). When a service is
      unmanaged, the categories on the front page will be updated and all
      outstanding outages cleared.</para>

      <bridgehead>Cosmetic Improvements</bridgehead>

      <para>There are a few cosmetic changes. There is a new color scheme for
      the default <filename>datacollection-config.xml </filename>reports.
      Please let us know if you like it. If not, the old colors can be found
      in the file <filename>snmp-graph.properties.oldcolors</filename>. Simply
      move it to <filename>snmp-graph.properties</filename> and restart
      Tomcat.</para>

      <para>There is also a new stylesheet. The old stylesheet is called
      <filename>styles.css.orig</filename> and can be found in the
      <filename>$OPENNMS_HOME/webapps/opennms/includes</filename> directory.
      Move it back to <filename>styles.css</filename> if you don't like the
      new one. And a couple of the asset fields now appear on the main node
      page.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Bug Fixes</title>

      <bridgehead>SNMP "select" Data Collection Reset</bridgehead>

      <para>The biggest bug fixed in this release also involves SNMP data
      collection. It was discovered that if a device has an IP address
      configured, but SNMP is not supported on that particular interface, any
      collections set on those interfaces would be set to "N" on the next
      rescan. Very frustrating, but it is better now. Also fixed in the
      release is an issue with the primary SNMP interface being on a NIC with
      other addresses. It would rarely cause issues, so not too many people
      should have experienced issues with this.</para>

      <bridgehead>New MX4J</bridgehead>

      <para>The MX4J jars have been upgraded to 3.0.1 which should fix issues
      with <filename>opennms.sh -v status</filename> that some people were
      experiencing.</para>

    <title>Changes in OpenNMS 1.2.5</title>

    <section>
      <title>New Features</title>

      <bridgehead>Simplify building on 32bit/64bit architectures</bridgehead>

      <para>Some new options were added to <filename>build.xml</filename> to
      simplify support of specifying the target architecture for which the C
      files are compiled. They are <varname>build.jni.compiler.arg</varname>
      for JNI code and <varname>build.postgresql.compiler.arg</varname> for
      the PostgreSQL iplike module. You would use something like "-m32" or
      "-m64" to force compilation of 32 bit or 64 bit binaries. Note that the
      options may differ for your platform and/or version of GCC. See your GCC
      man page for details. Thanks to Jonathan Sartin who submitted a patch.
      Bug 1331.</para>

      <bridgehead>Support for building on FreeBSD</bridgehead>

      <para>Some bugs have been fixed, and OpenNMS can now compile and run on
      FreeBSD. Thanks to Dennis Berger and Brent Verner for supplying patches
      (bug 1315). You should be able to compile for FreeBSD with the following
      build.properties file, assuming that you have used the ports tree to
      install RRDTool and PostgreSQL:</para>

      <programlisting>build.postgresql.include.dir=/usr/local/include/postgresql/server
build.postgresql.include2.dir=/usr/local/include
build.rrdtool.include.dir=/usr/local/include
build.rrdtool.lib.dir=/usr/local/lib
build.rrdtool.bin=/usr/local/bin/rrdtool</programlisting>

      <bridgehead>XMPP Group Notifications</bridgehead>

      <para>Added the ability to notifiy groups (chat rooms) via XMPP. A shout
      out to Jonathan Sartin for this work.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Bug Fixes</title>

      <bridgehead>Fixed Possible Poller Deadlock</bridgehead>

      <para>Addressed a possible poller problem that would cause outages that
      would never clear. This was fixed in 1.3.0 and backported to
      1.2.5.</para>

      <bridgehead>SNMP Data Collection Improvements</bridgehead>

      <para>Made some changes to make SNMP data collection faster as well as
      to improve startup time on systems with a large amount of data
      collection.</para>

      <para>A number of small bug fixes have been added:</para>

  <section>
    <title>Changes in OpenNMS 1.2.4</title>

    <section>
      <title>New Features</title>

      <bridgehead>The Use of "~" For Regular Expressions</bridgehead>

      <para>The ability to access the OpenNMS database via rules and filters
      is pretty powerful. With this release you can use the "~" character to
      imbed regular expressions on the right hand side of the rule or filter.
      Previously, the "~" character meant the same as "like". Note that this
      feature requires PostgreSQL 7.4 or higher. Earlier version will behave
      just like "like".</para>

      <bridgehead>RESOLVED Behavior Options</bridgehead>

      <para>Currently, when a "down" event notification is auto-acknowledged
      with an "up" event, a "RESOLVED" message gets sent to anyone who got the
      original "down" notice. However, if the problem is manually
      acknowledged, the "RESOLVED" message is not sent.</para>

      <para>With the release, when you configure a destination path, you can
      choose "on", "auto" or "off".</para>

      <para>"on" will send RESOLVED notices to anyone who got the down
      notice.</para>

      <para>"auto" will send RESOLVED notices to anyone who got the down
      notice, and the notice was auto-acknowledged (default).</para>

      <para>"off" will not send RESOLVED notices to anyone.</para>

      <para>Hats off to Bill for this one.</para>

      <bridgehead>The Ability to use %descr% in Notifications</bridgehead>

      <para>Suppose you have a SNMP Trap event that comes in with a huge
      description, including all the varbinds, etc. If you want to make a
      notification that triggers on that event, you will need to recreate or
      copy the description from the event into the notice. With this release,
      you can simply use %descr% to include the triggering event description
      in the notice.</para>

      <para>Thanks to Vincent for this addition.</para>

      <bridgehead>New "url" Parameter in the HTTP and HTTPS
      Plugins</bridgehead>

      <para>Prior to this release, it was hard to add service checks for web
      sites outside of the "root" directory. Now there is a "url" parameter to
      help with this. Suppose I wanted to monitor a wiki that was at
      "http://10.1.1.1/wiki". I'd add the following to
      capsd-configuration.xml:</para>

      <programlisting>        &lt;protocol-plugin protocol="HTTP-Wiki" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.capsd.HttpPlugin" scan="on" user-defined="false"&gt;
                &lt;property key="port" value="80"/&gt;
                &lt;property key="url" value="/wiki"/&gt;
                &lt;property key="timeout" value="3000"/&gt;
                &lt;property key="retry" value="2"/&gt;
        &lt;/protocol-plugin&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Then I would need to add a similar entry to
      poller-configuration.xml:</para>

      <programlisting>                &lt;service name="HTTP-Wiki" interval="300000" user-defined="false" status="on"&gt;
                        &lt;parameter key="retry" value="1"/&gt;
                        &lt;parameter key="timeout" value="3000"/&gt;
                        &lt;parameter key="port" value="80"/&gt;
                        &lt;parameter key="url" value="/wiki"/&gt;
                &lt;/service&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Don't forget the monitor line in the bottom section:</para>

      <programlisting>        &lt;monitor service="HTTP-Wiki"    class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.poller.monitors.HttpMonitor"/&gt;
</programlisting>

      <para>This will test each server for a "/wiki" URL, and if the return
      code is less the 400 the test will pass. Note that this will not work on
      password protected URLs like the one OpenNMS uses. That will be
      addressed in a new monitor coming in the next release (Basic AUTH

    <section>
      <title>New Features</title>

      <bridgehead>Scheduled Outages Editor</bridgehead>

      <para>The final version of Craig Miskell's (OGP) poll-outages editor is
      included in this release. Accessed from the Admin menu, it allows one to
      configure weekly, monthly and specific poll-outages from the webUI. A
      poll outage is where polling will stop for a particular set of devices
      or a package.</para>

      <para>Choose "Scheduled Outages" from the admin page, and the GUI will
      display the currently configured outages. You can edit those or create
      your own. You can then apply them to notifications, or to particular
      packages in the threshd, collectd and poller configurations.</para>

      <para>Please note that when applied to polling, no checks occur during
      the outage period. The services are not automatically considered "up".
      So if you have a maintenance window that starts at 2am and ends a 4am on
      Sundays, if you take the service down at 1:59 am and OpenNMS marks it as
      down, it will stay down until 4am.</para>

      <para>Hat off to Craig for this feature.</para>

      <bridgehead>Growl Support in OS X</bridgehead>

      <para>If you happen to run OpenNMS on OS X, you can now send
      notifications via Growl. Simply use "growlMessage" as one of the
      services in your destination path. Note that you have to be on the
      machine running OpenNMS to see them.</para>

      <bridgehead>New Events and Graphs</bridgehead>

      <para>There have been a number of event definitions added to OpenNMS,
      including those for NORTEL Contivity and Foundry devices. In addition,
      more support has been added for the SNMP Informant agent.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Bug Fixes</title>

      <para>Some people have reported an issue with service polling stopping.
      It was determined that, for some reason on some systems, a particular
      device or devices will cause a polling thread to hang. This would block
      polling from occuring. While the root cause of the issue has not been
      found (i.e. why the thread hangs) the code was modified so that a hung
      thread would not block the whole queue.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Changes in OpenNMS 1.2.2</title>

    <para>There is only one bug addressed in 1.2.2 concerning possible webUI
    exceptions if there are null values in the
    <varname>issnmpprimary</varname> field in the <varname>interface</varname>
    table of the database.</para>

    <title>Changes in OpenNMS 1.2.1</title>

    <section>
      <title>New Features</title>

      <bridgehead>XMPP Support</bridgehead>

      <para>Chris Abernethy contributed some code to allow notifications using
      the XMPP instant messaging protocol. This is most commonly associated
      with the Jabber open-source messaging project.</para>

      <para>Edit the <filename>xmpp-configuration.properties</filename> file
      to include the username and password of the user you want to use as the
      originator of the notice. Also include the server you wish to connect to
      in order to send the notice.</para>

      <para>Finally, add an XMPP Address to each user that should receive the
      notification, such as "myname@jabber.org".</para>

      <para>If your destination path command includes xmppMessage, then the
      notification text will be sent via XMPP to the user's XMPP address.
      Note: be sure that the user has allowed messages from the OpenNMS XMPP
      user. When I first tested this, I was blocking all messages from people
      not on my "buddy" list and I never received the notice.</para>

      <para>This was enhancement bug 1168.</para>

      <bridgehead>Support for Labels in SNMP Performance Reports</bridgehead>

      <para>Craig Miskell contributed some code that allows for text strings
      to be collected via SNMP and used to label SNMP Performance
      reports.</para>

      <para>For example, the Net-SNMP agents allows one to collect on disk
      statistics:</para>

      <programlisting>disk /
disk /boot
disk /opt/distros</programlisting>

      <para>This will create a table where the first row is disk space on
      root, the second row is the disk space on /boot, etc.</para>

      <para>The problem is that this configuration:</para>

      <programlisting>disk /boot
disk /
disk /opt/distros</programlisting>

      <para>Is also valid, but the /boot parition is now index one, and / is
      index two.</para>

      <para>Previously, one had to be a little saavy about how to configure
      the order of disk volumes, but now the disk label can just be collected
      and displayed.</para>

      <para>For example, we currently collect on the first instance of the
      Net-SNMP disk table, and just assume it's root:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;group  name = "net-snmp-root-disk" ifType = "ignore"&gt;
        &lt;mibObj oid=".1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.9.1.6" instance="1" alias="ns-disk-root-tot"    type="gauge"/&gt;
        &lt;mibObj oid=".1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.9.1.7" instance="1" alias="ns-disk-root-avail"    type="gauge"/&gt;
        &lt;mibObj oid=".1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.9.1.8" instance="1" alias="ns-disk-root-used"    type="gauge"/&gt;
        &lt;mibObj oid=".1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.9.1.9" instance="1" alias="ns-disk-root-pct"    type="gauge"/&gt;
&lt;/group&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>To use this feature, we convert it to something more generic, disk
      1 instead of root:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;mibObj oid=".1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.9.1.2" instance="1" alias="ns-disk-1-name"    type="string"/&gt;
&lt;mibObj oid=".1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.9.1.6" instance="1" alias="ns-disk-1-tot"    type="gauge"/&gt;
&lt;mibObj oid=".1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.9.1.7" instance="1" alias="ns-disk-1-avail"    type="gauge"/&gt;
&lt;mibObj oid=".1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.9.1.8" instance="1" alias="ns-disk-1-used"    type="gauge"/&gt;
&lt;mibObj oid=".1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.9.1.9" instance="1" alias="ns-disk-1-pct"    type="gauge"/&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Note the new first line. The ".2" OID in this table is the disk
      label, which we now collect. It gets stored in a file called
      <filename>$OPENNMS_HOME/share/rrd/snmp/$NODEID/strings.properties</filename>,
      where the <varname>$NODEID</varname> is the node number of the device
      being collected.</para>

      <para>A sample string.properties file looks like this:</para>

      <programlisting>#Wed Mar 16 17:46:25 EST 2005
ns-disk-3-name=/opt/distros
ns-disk-2-name=/boot
ns-disk-1-name=/</programlisting>

      <para>Once the <filename>datacollection-config.xml </filename>file is
      changed, and OpenNMS is restarted, collectd will begin storing the
      collected strings.</para>

      <para>So, how are they used? To display them in reports, edit the
      <filename>snmp-graph.properties</filename> file. Everything in this file
      that is in "curly braces" is something that OpenNMS supplied to RRDTool
      (or jRobin).</para>

      <programlisting>report.netsnmp.disk1percent.name=Percentage Disk Space on 1
report.netsnmp.disk1percent.columns=ns-disk-1-pct
report.netsnmp.disk1percent.type=node
report.netsnmp.disk1percent.propertiesValues=ns-disk-1-name
report.netsnmp.disk1percent.command=--title="Percentage Disk Space on {ns-disk-1-name}" \
 DEF:dpercent={rrd1}:ns-disk-1-pct:AVERAGE \
 LINE2:dpercent#0000ff:"% Disk Space Used" \
 GPRINT:dpercent:AVERAGE:"Avg  \\: %8.2lf %s" \
 GPRINT:dpercent:MIN:"Min  \\: %8.2lf %s" \
 GPRINT:dpercent:MAX:"Max  \\: %8.2lf %s\n"</programlisting>

      <para>Note the new "properitesValues" line. This line will look for the
      value(s) listed in the appropriate
      <filename>strings.properties</filename> file, such as
      <varname>ns-disk-1-name</varname>. Then putting that value in curly
      braces, as in {ns-disk-1-name} will cause OpenNMS to replace it with the
      proper value.</para>

      <para>By default, OpenNMS now collects on the first 5 disks defined by
      Net-SNMP and disks 2 through 4 as defined by the host-resources MIB.
      Please feel free to improve on this configurations, and post your diff
      as an enchancement bug on <ulink
      url="http://bugzilla.opennms.org">http://bugzilla.opennms.org</ulink>
      for inclusion in a future release.</para>

      <para>Some caveats: Currently this only works for node level
      information. Also, the labels can't be used in notifications or events,
      so if you get a highThreshold alert on disk usage, you won't be able to
      tell exactly which disk (but it should be easy to look up).</para>

      <para>Many thanks to Craig for this work.</para>

      <bridgehead>New DHCP Poller</bridgehead>

      <para>Bill Ayres (OGP) has improved the DHCP poller. The new default
      <filename>dhcp-configuration.xml</filename> file now looks like
      this:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;DhcpdConfiguration
        port="5818"
        macAddress="00:06:0D:BE:9C:B2"
        myIpAddress="127.0.0.1"
        extendedMode="false"
        requestIpAddress="127.0.0.1"&gt;
&lt;/DhcpdConfiguration&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>The <varname>port</varname> and <varname>macAddress</varname>
      options were there before, but now you can add
      <varname>myIpAddress</varname>, <varname>extendedMode</varname> and a
      <varname>requestIpAddress</varname>.</para>

      <para>With the default configuration, the DHCP poller should act as
      before (although on my test network it now correctly sees that my
      Airport Express does not have a DHCP server on it that is accessible
      from the "wired" side). This is "broadcast" mode.</para>

      <para>The following describes each of the new variables:</para>

      <para><emphasis>myIpAddress</emphasis>: This parameter will usually be
      set to the ip address of the OpenNMS server, which puts the DHCP poller
      in "relay" mode as opposed to "broadcast" mode. In "relay" mode, the
      DHCP server being polled will unicast its responses directly back to the
      specified ip address rather than broadcasting its responses. This allows
      DHCP servers to be polled even though they are not on the same subnet as
      the OpenNMS server, and without the aid of an external relay.</para>

      <para>usage: myIpAddress="10.11.12.13" or myIpAddress="broadcast"
      (default)</para>

      <para><emphasis>extendedMode</emphasis>: When extendedMode is false, the
      DHCP poller will send a DISCOVER and expect an OFFER in return. When
      extendedMode is true, the DHCP poller will first send a DISCOVER. If no
      valid response is received it will send an INFORM. If no valid response
      is received it will then send a REQUEST. OFFER, ACK, and NAK are all
      considered valid responses in extendedMode.</para>

      <para>usage: extendedMode="true" or extendedMode="false"
      (default)</para>

      <para><emphasis>requestIpAddress</emphasis>: This parameter only applies
      to REQUEST queries sent to the DHCP service when extendedMode is true.
      If an ip address is specified, that ip address will be requested in the
      query. If "targetHost" is specified, the DHCP server's own ip address
      will be requested. Since a well-managed server will probably not respond
      to a request for its own ip, this parameter can also be set to
      "targetSubnet". This is similar to "targetHost" except the DHCP server's
      ip address is incremented or decremented by 1 to obtain an ip address
      that is on the same subnet. (The resulting address will not be on the
      same subnet if the DHCP server's subnet is a /32 or /31. Otherwise, the
      algorithm used should be reliable.)</para>

      <para>usage: requestIpAddress="10.77.88.99" or
      requestIpAddress="targetHost" or requestIpAddress="targetSubnet"
      (default)</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Caution on usage:</emphasis> If in extended
      mode, the time required to complete the poll for an unresponsive node is
      increased by a factor of 3. Thus it is a good idea to limit the number
      of retries to a small number.</para>

      <para>Thanks to Bill for his hard work on this.</para>

      <bridgehead>GUI for <filename>snmp-config.xml</filename></bridgehead>

      <para>Gerald Turner has written a useful admin GUI for managing the
      <filename>snmp-config.xml</filename> file. It allows you to add specific
      IP addresses and IP address ranges and associate them with community
      strings.</para>

      <para>For example, if you have the following default
      <filename>snmp-config.xml</filename> file:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;snmp-config retry="3" timeout="800" read-community="public" write-community="private"&gt;

&lt;/snmp-config&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>this will use the default community string of "public" for SNMP
      requests. Using the GUI, one can add a range that, say, uses
      "public2":</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;snmp-config retry="3" timeout="800" read-community="public" write-community="private"&gt;
    &lt;definition read-community="public2"&gt;
        &lt;range begin="192.168.0.1" end="192.168.0.254"/&gt;
    &lt;/definition&gt;
&lt;/snmp-config&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>You can also add specific IP addresses, say this one for
      "public3":</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;snmp-config retry="3" timeout="800" read-community="public" write-community="private"&gt;
    &lt;definition read-community="public2"&gt;
        &lt;range begin="192.168.0.1" end="192.168.0.254"/&gt;
    &lt;/definition&gt;
    &lt;definition read-community="public3"&gt;
        &lt;specific&gt;192.168.1.1&lt;/specific&gt;
    &lt;/definition&gt;
&lt;/snmp-config&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>This feature will automatically do things like split ranges. For
      example, add "public4" as the string for 192.168.0.50:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;snmp-config retry="3" timeout="800" read-community="public" write-community="private"&gt;
    &lt;definition read-community="public2"&gt;
        &lt;range begin="192.168.0.1" end="192.168.0.49"/&gt;
        &lt;range begin="192.168.0.51" end="192.168.0.254"/&gt;
    &lt;/definition&gt;
    &lt;definition read-community="public3"&gt;
        &lt;specific&gt;192.168.1.1&lt;/specific&gt;
    &lt;/definition&gt;
    &lt;definition read-community="public4"&gt;
        &lt;specific&gt;192.168.0.50&lt;/specific&gt;
    &lt;/definition&gt;
&lt;/snmp-config&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>There is a caveat. If you add a specific entry like 192.168.1.1
      above, and then go back and add a range that includes that specific IP,
      the range will overwrite the specific entry, as in this example for
      "public5":</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;snmp-config retry="3" timeout="800" read-community="public" write-community="private"&gt;
    &lt;definition read-community="public2"&gt;
        &lt;range begin="192.168.0.1" end="192.168.0.49"/&gt;
        &lt;range begin="192.168.0.51" end="192.168.0.254"/&gt;
    &lt;/definition&gt;
    &lt;definition read-community="public4"&gt;
        &lt;specific&gt;192.168.0.50&lt;/specific&gt;
    &lt;/definition&gt;
    &lt;definition read-community="public5"&gt;
        &lt;range begin="192.168.1.1" end="192.168.1.254"/&gt;
    &lt;/definition&gt;
&lt;/snmp-config&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>This feature was designed to help manage this file before
      discovery It will not update the community string for an SNMP agent that
      is already being collectd. In the case that the community string for a
      device changes, and this results in a data collection failure event, it
      is possible to change the community string to the correct one without
      restarting OpenNMS. Use this GUI to make sure the community string is
      correctly in the <filename>snmp-config.xml</filename> file, and then go
      to the device's node page. Click the link that says "Update SNMP" and
      collection should resume.</para>

      <para>This was bug 1167, and I'm leaving it open as an enhancement
      because there is one thing left I'd like to see. I'd like to see the
      current contents of the <filename>snmp-config.xml</filename> file
      displayed on this page as well. It is hoped that it will be available
      for the next release.</para>

      <para>Hats of to Gerald for this work.</para>

    <title>Changes in OpenNMS 1.2.0</title>

    <para>The only changes between 1.1.5 and 1.2.0 are some bug fixes and the
    addition of a few more datacollection values and reports.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Changes in OpenNMS 1.1.5</title>

    <para>The current development goal of the OpenNMS team is to get a new,
    stable release out as soon as time will allow. This will allow for a new
    development cycle that can be very daring in its scope while still
    providing a stable, production application. This release is our second
    release candidate for 1.2.0, and if testing goes well it will be released
    shortly.</para>

    <para>The reason 1.1.4 did not become 1.2.0 was due to a lot of code
    changes to the poller. In fact, the poller has been pretty much rewritten
    and the code reorganized. Those who look at the new poller code should be
    impressed with the work Matt (OGP) did.</para>

    <para>1.1.5 also represents a new development philosophy for the team.
    OpenNMS is now written using "test driven development". In a nutshell:
    when a new feature is desired, or a bug needs fixing, the first piece of
    code that is written is a test to insure that the feature works or that
    the bug does not occur. Since no change is made to the code at this point,
    the test obviously will fail. Then the feature is written or the bug fixed
    until the test passes, and the final step is to clean up the code to
    remove duplication, etc.</para>

    <para>Over the next year, this main change in the development philosophy
    of OpenNMS will reap huge benefits in terms of speed of development and
    code quality.</para>

    <bridgehead>Notifications on Auto-Acknowledged Events</bridgehead>

    <para>The reason the poller code was rewritten was mainly in support of
    this one new feature. OpenNMS has three main functions: service polling,
    data collection and event management. This last feature was hampered by an
    issue with auto-acknowledgement.</para>

    <para>Here's the scenario: A service is down and an event is generated.
    This event triggers a notification, which walks a destination path. The
    first step in the path is to wait for 2 minutes before doing anything, and
    then it is to page the on call person, and if the notification is not
    acknowledged in 15 minutes, the manager is to get paged.</para>

    <para>Well, let's assume the outage occurs at 2 in the morning and lasts
    for four minutes. After the first two minutes, a page is sent to the
    on-call person and it wakes him up.</para>

    <para>Now, prior to this release, when the service is restored two minutes
    later, the auto-acknowledge code would acknowledge the "down" notice, so
    the manager would not get paged. However, unless notices were configured
    for "up" events, the on call person would not know that the service has
    been restored, so they would have to wake up, get logged in and then
    notice that the problem had gone away.</para>

    <para>If notices were configured for "up" events, the on call person would
    know that the service was up and could go back to bed. Unfortunately, if
    the "up" notice walked the same path as the "down" notice, it would have
    to be manually acknowledged or the manager would get a page saying that
    the service was now "up" without ever receiving the "down" page.</para>

    <para>This obviously isn't very useful.</para>

    <para>So now there is an option to send a "resolution" notice when a
    "down" event gets auto-acknowledged by an "up" event. The same notice that
    gets sent with the "down" will be sent with the "up" with the word
    "RESOLVED:" prefixed to the message. It will only be sent to those people
    who got the "down" notice and in the same manner, i.e. e-mail, page,
    etc.</para>

    <para>There are a few things to consider:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Notices concerning "up" events will still get treated as
        separate notifications. This only concerns auto-acknowledged events.
        To avoid the scenario above, "up" notices should be turned off, and
        they have been in the default configuration.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>OpenNMS "down" events, such as nodeLostService and nodeDown will
        now always be matched with the corresponding "up" event. For example:
        HTTP stops on a server, so a nodeLostService event is sent. A short
        while later the node itself goes down, causing a nodeDown event. When
        the server is restored, everything is running, so a nodeUp event gets
        generated and a nodeRegainedService event for HTTP. In the past this
        would not happen. Once the node came back up, if HTTP was running no
        event would be sent. If the service was still down, a second
        nodeLostService event would be generated.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>For those of you who keep up with the code, notice that there is no
    longer a separate outage daemon. All of that functionality has been
    integrated into the poller.</para>

    <para>To configure this functionality, look at the
    notifd-configuration.xml file. Here is an example:</para>

    <programlisting>        &lt;auto-acknowledge resolution-prefix="RESOLVED: " notify="true" uei="uei.opennms.org/nodes/nodeRegainedService" 
                          acknowledge="uei.opennms.org/nodes/nodeLostService"&gt;
                          &lt;match&gt;nodeid&lt;/match&gt;
                          &lt;match&gt;interfaceid&lt;/match&gt;
                          &lt;match&gt;serviceid&lt;/match&gt;
        &lt;/auto-acknowledge&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>This says "when a nodeRegainedService event is generated,
    auto-acknowledge all notices based on a nodeLostService event where the
    nodeid, interfaceid and serviceid match. In addition, send an notification
    to all parties who received the "down" notice prefixed with the word
    RESOLVED:".</para>

    <para>To disable this feature, set notify="false". "true" is the default.
    The resolution-prefix can be changed to suit non-English languages or user
    preference.</para>

    <bridgehead>A New RADIUS Poller</bridgehead>

    <para>Jonathan Sartin (OGP) has written a new poller to poll RADIUS
    servers. The relavent configuration in capsd is:</para>

    <programlisting>        &lt;protocol-plugin protocol="RadiusAuth" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.capsd.RadiusAuthPlugin" scan="on" user-defined="false"&gt;
                 &lt;property key="timeout" value="3000"/&gt;
                 &lt;property key="user" value="TEST"/&gt;
                 &lt;property key="password" value="test"/&gt;
                 &lt;property key="secret" value="opennms"/&gt;
                 &lt;property key="retry" value="2"/&gt;
        &lt;/protocol-plugin&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>Note that this requires that a username of "TEST" with a password of
    "test" and secret of "opennms" is configured on the server in order for
    this service to be discovered.</para>

    <para>The poller configuration looks similar:</para>

    <programlisting>                &lt;service name="RadiusAuth" interval="300000" user-defined="false" status="on"&gt;
                        &lt;parameter key="retry" value="3"/&gt;
                        &lt;parameter key="timeout" value="3000"/&gt;
                        &lt;parameter key="user" value="TEST"/&gt;
                        &lt;parameter key="password" value="test"/&gt;
                        &lt;parameter key="secret" value="opennms"/&gt;
                        &lt;parameter key="rrd-repository" value="/var/opennms/rrd/response"/&gt;
                        &lt;parameter key="ds-name" value="radiusauth"/&gt;
                &lt;/service&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>This will also store and graph the response time.</para>

    <bridgehead>SNMP Primary Interface Changes</bridgehead>

    <para>Thanks to Bill Ayres (OGP) we have some new behavior in capsd with
    respect to the primary SNMP interface.</para>

    <para>Previously, there had to be a way to map an IP Address from the
    ipAddrTable to an ifIndex in the ifTable. This was so interface-level
    statistics could be matched up with IP addresses. There were cases,
    however, especially with devices like firewalls where no valid primary
    interface could be determined and thus no data could be collected from the
    device.</para>

    <para>This code will address this, and OpenNMS will still be able to poll
    some SNMP data without having the ifIndex mapping.</para>

    <bridgehead>The MATCH-ANY-UEI Event</bridgehead>

    <para>This new event will never be generated internally, but it does serve
    a useful purpose. Suppose there is a need to get all events from a
    particular server sent as notifications. By choosing this UEI when
    building the notification, it will match the UEI of any event generated by
    the system.</para>

    <para>Note that this can be dangerous, especially on systems that receive
    a lot of SNMP traps. To use this properly, set up a limiting rule, such
    as:</para>

    <programlisting>    &lt;notification name="Test-Match-any" status="off"&gt;
        &lt;uei&gt;MATCH-ANY-UEI&lt;/uei&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Test&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;rule&gt;(IPADDR == '10.1.4.10')&lt;/rule&gt;
        &lt;destinationPath&gt;Email-Admin&lt;/destinationPath&gt;
        &lt;text-message&gt;&amp;lt;p&gt;This is a generic notice to match any event UEI 
        that matches the filter rule.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;uei: %uei% 
        &lt;/text-message&gt;
        &lt;subject&gt;Notice #%noticeid%: Match Any event: %uei%&lt;/subject&gt;
    &lt;/notification&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>This will send a notice on any event where the IP address is
    10.1.4.10.</para>

    <bridgehead>Added Support for the ifAlias Field</bridgehead>

    <para>A number of people use the ifAlias field to add a useful description
    to a particular interface. Bill Ayres (OGP), Mike Huot (OGP) and Wrolf
    Courtney are responsible for adding the field to the database and printing
    it out on various pages in the webUI.</para>

    <bridgehead>Many Documentation Changes and Installer No Longer
    Automatic</bridgehead>

    <para>DJ Gregor (OGP) has made a lot of changes to our documentation as
    well as the installer. Please, please read the installation guide and note
    that the install program that sets up the database, etc., is no longer run
    when the OpenNMS packages are installed. It will need to be run manually
    after every install. The command:</para>

    <programlisting>$OPENNMS_HOME/bin/install -disU</programlisting>

    <para>should get things working most of the time.</para>

    <bridgehead>JavaMail Bug Fix for Availability Reports</bridgehead>

    <para>A bug was fixed with Availability Reports using the JavaMailer
    class. Some installations of Tomcat included the JavaMail API and
    therefore our JavaMailer would work with those installations. Some users
    are experiencing problems because their install does not have the API in
    the Tomcat <filename>common/lib</filename> directory. The build task was
    modified to include the appropriate jar files in our
    <filename>WEB-INF/lib</filename> directory in case they were
    missing.</para>

    <para>An enhancement was also made to the JavaMailer include a Mail
    Transport Agent (MTA). This MTA is free to use and was provided by John
    Udell (found here: <ulink url="http://zoe.nu/">http://zoe.nu/</ulink>).
    It's included in the OpenNMS libs as "jmta.jar". This enables OpenNMS to
    use a Java mailer without needing a relay SMTP host.</para>

    <para>A new flag has been added to the
    <filename>javamail-configuration.properties</filename> file:
    "org.opennms.core.utils.useJMTA". It defaults to "true".</para>

    <bridgehead>Other Minor Enhancements</bridgehead>

    <para>There are a number of other enhancements worth noting:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Custom KSC reports can now be accessed directly from the main
        page.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>A number of new event definitions have been added, including
        those for BMC PATROL, MGE UPSs, Network Appliance, Snort, NetBotz, and
        Compaq Insight Manager.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Both the datacollection-config.xml and snmp-graph.properties
        files (responsible for data collection and display) have been enhanced
        and reorganized. The default loadavg report for Net-SNMP agents has
        been replaced with a really nifty CPU report by Ray Van Dolson.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>OpenNMS will recognize if a web page is listening on the Dell
        OpenManage port, and there will be a link from the webUI if so.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>There are other small fixes and improvements too numerous to list.
    Please feel free to check out CVS and the CHANGELOG for more.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Changes in OpenNMS 1.1.4</title>

    <para>Longtime users of OpenNMS will be pleasantly surprised at the speed
    enhancements of this release. Most of the new code changes focused on
    performance or our goal of making OpenNMS more purely Java (eliminating
    the need for JNI calls to C++ code and perl).</para>

    <bridgehead>Data Collection Queuing System</bridgehead>

    <para>A new queuing system for writing the data collection RRD files has
    been added. Experimental tests have shown that the I/O subsystem is the
    bottle neck for Data Collector performance.</para>

    <para>In order to increase the capacity of our data collector we have
    added an intelligent queuing system for all of our RRD Output. This
    improves performance for us in two ways. One is that it frees up the data
    collection threads to get back to the work of data collection right away.
    As a side benefit it also frees up the polling threads that output RRD
    data related to latency. This makes the data much more accurate.</para>

    <para>The second way that the queuing system provides performance
    improvements is by queuing collected data on a per file basis. Since
    writing a few extra bytes to an RRD file while its open anyway adds very
    little to the update time, this causes the average update cost per data
    point to go down the further the collector gets behind. What this means is
    that you will not lose any data points if the collector is configured to
    collect more than you I/O system can read/write without queuing. It just
    means that the data that is in the files is behind the actual
    collection.</para>

    <para>A last way the queuing system improves data collector performance is
    by giving priority to non-zero data. On many networks, as much as 60% of
    the collected data is zero valued. In most situations, data that has
    remained zero for a long period of time is unimportant data. For this
    reason we give files with non-zero data points priority over files that
    have only zero data points. Monitored interfaces that have only zero
    ifErrors or ifDiscards, for example, will not hold up writing of the data
    for systems that have positive ifErrors and ifDiscards. Please see
    <filename>$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/rrd-configuration.properties</filename> for
    configurations details.</para>

    <para>Thanks to Rackspace and Eric Evans for providing equipment to help
    us implement this and to General Electric's John Lee and Neeraj Malve for
    helping to test this.</para>

    <bridgehead>JRobin Support</bridgehead>

    <para>Though the Collection Queuing above provides a great deal of
    performance benefit, for very high capacity data collection environments
    it was not sufficient. We have found the JRobin 1.4.0 provides performs
    better than RRDTool in our environment. The primary reason for this is
    that JRobin reads a much smaller amount of data on an RRD Open than
    RRDTool does. This increases throughput on systems like ours that max out
    the I/O subsystem doing an open, update, and close on a huge number of
    RRDs. An additional benefit of JRobin is that it is multi-thread enabled
    (unlike our libjrrd.so shared library that interacts with RRDTool) however
    this does not impact performance very much because the contention is not
    the bottle neck. In fact, on some systems that have as many as 100 data
    collection threads, we found that have as few as 2-10 RRD write threads
    were sufficient to populate the RRD files.</para>

    <para>The only unfortunate part of using JRobin is that the file format
    for JRobin is not the same as for RRDTool. This means other tools you may
    be using will not work with JRobin RRD files and will have to converted or
    replaced. JRobin does have some tools available and you should check out
    their website at www.jrobin.org to see what is available. Additionally,
    JRobin supports programmatically all of the features of RRDTool, so it
    should be easy to write a compatible tool. If you do so, please consider
    contributing it either to us or to the JRobin team.</para>

    <para>The last benefit of JRobin is that is helps us to reach our goal of
    a 100% Pure Java version of OpenNMS that can work 'out of the box' on any
    system.</para>

    <para>Thanks go to the JRobin team for providing this excellent RRD
    implementation. Thanks also to Rackspace for providing the equipment to
    let us implement this.</para>

    <bridgehead>Filter Parser Performance Enhancements</bridgehead>

    <para>Thanks to Chris Fedde of On Command, we have found that the SQL
    queries produced by our filtering code were, at times, extremely
    inefficient. On a moderately sized network of only 15K interfaces the
    queries used to define categories could take as long as three minutes on a
    4 CPU system. As a result of this, we have reworked the filter parser and
    now produce much better queries. The equivalent query would now only take
    about a second on the same system. Thanks a lot to Ted Kaczmarek and
    Alexander Hoogerhuis for helping us test it.</para>

    <bridgehead>Delete Node, Interface and Service Improvements</bridgehead>

    <para>There have been a large number of bugs reported with respect to
    deleting nodes from the OpenNMS GUI. This code has been completely
    overhauled in OpenNMS 1.1.4. The new strategy has been to mark a
    node/interface/service deleted rather than actually deleting it. (The node
    completely removed from the database by Vacuumd discussed below.) This
    allows any web pages that are currently viewing the node to react
    properly. Additionally, deletes now happen as database transactions
    providing for performance and data integrity (i.e. no orphaned interface
    records) and you are not left with a half-deleted node.</para>

    <para>In addition to overhauling node deletion, we have also added the
    ability to delete interfaces and services. Administrators have a delete
    link at the top of service and interface detail pages.</para>

    <para>All the users of OpenNMS helped by writing defects and complaining
    about this bug. Special thanks to Ted Kaczmarek, Jonathan Sartin, and Mike
    Huot for their help testing and characterizing these problems and their
    solution.</para>

    <bridgehead>Vacuumd</bridgehead>

    <para>Since nodes, interfaces and services are only marked deleted and not
    actually removed from the database when a delete occurs, some way was
    needed to ensure that the data actually got removed eventually. To do this
    Vacuumd was introduced to provide a mechanism to periodically run database
    maintenance operations. Vacuumd's configuration consists of a set of
    database statements to be run daily (or whichever period is preferable).
    There are four maintenance operations provided by OpenNMS by default.
    These are as follows: delete nodes that have been marked as deleted,
    delete interfaces that have been marked as deleted, delete services that
    have been marked as deleted, and delete any event that is not related to a
    current outage and is older than 6 weeks.</para>

    <para>In order to make sure that Vacuumd properly deletes all the data
    associated with the nodes, interfaces, services or other entries that it
    deletes we have added cascading delete constraints to the database. With
    these if you do a 'DELETE FROM nodes WHERE nodeid=11', for example. You
    delete all the related information, its interfaces, the services on those
    interfaces, the outages related to the node, the events, etc.,
    etc..</para>

    <bridgehead>Database Connection 'Leak' Found</bridgehead>

    <para>Though not an actual leak because the connections are garbage
    collected, we found a problem in the code where database connections were
    being dropped and left for the garbage collector to clean up. This
    problem, which occurred primarily during discovery, would result in an
    abnormally large number of outstanding connections to the database to be
    cleaned up by the garbage collector. Discovery of large networks caused
    the number of connections to the database to easily grow beyond the number
    allowed. Thanks to Chris Fedde and OnCommand for helping us track down
    this problem.</para>

    <bridgehead>JavaMail</bridgehead>

    <para>An OpenNMS objective to become a 100% Java application, requires
    elimination the following dependencies.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>/bin/mail</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Perl</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Metamail package</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>These dependencies are used for two functions of the OpenNMS
    application: Notification and Availability reporting.</para>

    <para>Installing a fresh copy of OpenNMS will now use the Java Mail API by
    default. Upgrade installs will create two new files that the user will
    have to merge into their existing configurations:
    <filename>destinationPaths.xml.rpmnew</filename> and
    <filename>notficationCommands.xml.rpmnew</filename>.</para>

    <para>The <filename>javamail-configuration.properties</filename> file
    should be modified to specify the sender's address and the SMTP server
    address. This file also provides support for SMTP servers requiring user
    and password authentication.</para>

    <para>There are also major changes to the
    <filename>notificationCommands.xml</filename> file. The schema definition
    for this file has changed requiring that the &lt;command&gt; tag now has
    an attribute called 'binary' and a value of either "true" or "false". This
    flag indicates to the OpenNMS notification processes that the command
    definition is either a system command (as it always has been prior to this
    release) or an OpenNMS Java class (see deveolper notes below). The 1.1.4
    version of this file now has added the following new command
    definitions:</para>

    <para><programlisting>&lt;command binary="false"&gt;
&lt;name&gt;javaPagerEmail&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;execute&gt;org.opennms.netmgt.notifd.JavaMailNotificationStrategy&lt;/execute&gt;
&lt;comment&gt;class for sending pager email notifications&lt;/comment&gt;
&lt;argument streamed="false"&gt;
&lt;switch&gt;-subject&lt;/switch&gt;
&lt;/argument&gt;
&lt;argument streamed="false"&gt;
&lt;switch&gt;-pemail&lt;/switch&gt;
&lt;/argument&gt;
&lt;argument streamed="false"&gt;
&lt;switch&gt;-tm&lt;/switch&gt;
&lt;/argument&gt;
&lt;/command&gt;

&lt;command binary="false"&gt;
&lt;name&gt;javaEmail&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;execute&gt;org.opennms.netmgt.notifd.JavaMailNotificationStrategy&lt;/execute&gt;
&lt;comment&gt;class for sending email notifications&lt;/comment&gt;
&lt;argument streamed="false"&gt;
&lt;switch&gt;-subject&lt;/switch&gt;
&lt;/argument&gt;
&lt;argument streamed="false"&gt;
&lt;switch&gt;-email&lt;/switch&gt;
&lt;/argument&gt;
&lt;argument streamed="false"&gt;
&lt;switch&gt;-tm&lt;/switch&gt;
&lt;/argument&gt;
&lt;/command&gt;</programlisting></para>

    <para>Notice a few changes:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The <computeroutput>&lt;command&gt; </computeroutput>tag now has
        an attribute called 'binary' that when set to "true" will cause the
        notification process to attempt to execute a system command specified
        in the &lt;execute&gt; tag. When not set or set to anything other than
        "true", the notification process assumes it is an OpenNMS notification
        class and will instantiate it and execute its 'send()' method. By
        convention, the "binary" attribute will be set to "false" when new
        notification classes are implemented.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The <computeroutput>&lt;substitution&gt;
        </computeroutput>arguments are not used for notification classes but
        are still supported for notification commands. These "substitution"
        arguments (allthough not gramatially intuitive) are passed to system
        commands as a command line argument when the 'binary' attribute is set
        to "true" and is otherwise ignored.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The <computeroutput>&lt;execute&gt;</computeroutput> tag now
        allows the specification of an OpenNMS Java class name. This class
        name must implement the NotificationStrategy interface (see developer
        notes below). The new JavaMailNotificationStrategy class excepts the
        following <computeroutput>&lt;switch&gt;</computeroutput> tags:
        -subject, -email, -pemail, -tm.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The <filename>destinationPaths.xml</filename> file has changed
    making the default email and pager email notifications use the new Java
    Mail API. All 'email' and 'pagerEmail' <computeroutput>&lt;command&gt;
    </computeroutput>tags have been changed to the new 'javaEmail' and
    'javaPagerEmail' commands in
    <filename>$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/notificationCommands.xml</filename>.</para>

    <bridgehead>Installer / Build System Improvements</bridgehead>

    <para>Thanks so much to new OpenNMS committer DJ Gregor for all his hard
    work on improving the OpenNMS build and install code. Thanks to DJ's
    efforts the installer has improved greatly and is now written completely
    in Java removing (along with the JavaMail feature and Dave Hustace)
    OpenNMS's dependency on Perl.</para>

    <para>That said, we do expect some issues with this, as the installer does
    do a lot of database checks and conversions, and some users have large
    databases.</para>

    <bridgehead>Using A Parameter for Notifications</bridgehead>

    <para>Some notifications, like one based on a highThresholdExceeded event,
    would benefit from being able to key off of not only the event UEI, but a
    value within the event itself.</para>

    <para>With 1.1.4, the ability has been added to key off the parameter name
    and to match it with a particular value.</para>

    <programlisting>    &lt;notification name="HighThreshold" status="on"&gt;
        &lt;uei&gt;uei.opennms.org/threshold/highThresholdExceeded&lt;/uei&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;A high threshold event&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;rule&gt;(IPADDR IPLIKE *.*.*.*)&lt;/rule&gt;
        &lt;destinationPath&gt;Email-Admin&lt;/destinationPath&gt;
        &lt;text-message&gt;A high threshold was reached on data source %parm[#1]% with %parm[#2]% and %parm[#3]% and %parm[#4]%.&lt;/text-message&gt;
        &lt;subject&gt;Notice #%noticeid%&lt;/subject&gt;
        &lt;varbind&gt;
            &lt;vbname&gt;ds&lt;/vbname&gt;
            &lt;vbvalue&gt;cpu&lt;/vbvalue&gt;
        &lt;/varbind&gt;
    &lt;/notification&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>This will cause the notification to match if it is a high threshold
    event involving the data source name of "cpu" only.</para>

    <para>Note that you must use the name of the parameter, and you can only
    use one. There is a TODO to add the ability to use more than one parameter
    for the match and to use a particular parameter number instead of just the
    name.</para>

    <bridgehead>Other Improvements/Changes/Bug Fixes</bridgehead>

    <para>Here is a small list of other improvements in 1.1.4:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The OpenNMS Group is partnering with the creators of the SNMP
        Informant Windows SNMP agent (formally SNMP4PC), and so a number of
        SNMP Informant data collections and reports have been added.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>A bug was fixed with respect to the RTC Categories section which
        could cause the services of new nodes to be counted more than
        once.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>To make better use of Bill Ayres' displayCategory field in the
        Assets table, a new event was created that will update RTC when the
        Assets table is changed (which will cause such changes to be reflected
        without a restart).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Also to make this work better, new nodes are created with an
        empty asset record. Thus queries like <computeroutput>displayCategory
        != "test"</computeroutput> will work.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Michael Huot added some code that causes the webUI to turn to
        light blue, similar to "Calculating ..." when the webUI loses
        connectivity with OpenNMS. Code has also been added so the webUI will
        attempt to reconnect to OpenNMS when this happens. This should remove
        the dependency on needing to restart Tomcat after restarting
        OpenNMS.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>RPM dependencies have been fixed (bug #906). A packaging error
        caused previous releases to only include a subset of package
        dependencies. Some dependencies have also been fixed for Mandrake
        distributions (bug #933).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>A generalized solution has been implemented for choosing a
        proper Java Runtime Environment at runtime. See
        <filename>$OPENNMS_HOME/bin/runjava -h</filename> for details.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The OpenNMS startup script was rewritten to be more
        cross-platform friendly and uses the JRE chosen by
        <filename>runjava</filename>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Upgraded to the latest PostgreSQL JDBC driver,
        <filename>pg74.215.jdbc3.jar</filename>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>WebUI to OpenNMS communication has been changed to use a
        separate connection for each request, instead of a single connection
        that persists until Tomcat is restarted (or the webapp is reloaded).
        This eliminates exceptions that are thrown when certain administrative
        actions are performed (e.g.: adding a new node through the webUI) if
        OpenNMS is restarted without restarting Tomcat. See bug #897.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Changes in OpenNMS 1.1.3 and above</title>

    <para>A tremendous amount of work has been done "under the covers" to
    OpenNMS, and the following features were added in 1.1.3:</para>

    <bridgehead>Support for Duplicate IP Addresses</bridgehead>

    <para>Prior to this release, the algorithm that OpenNMS used to determine
    if a particular interface belonged to a particular node was simple. An
    SNMP walk was done on the device, and all of the IP addresses on that
    device were associated with the node. If that walk discovered a
    "duplicate" address, say from a private network or some backup link, it
    would assume that all of the addresses on that device belonged to the
    device that was discovered with that IP address first.</para>

    <para>This could result in "merged" nodes, especially in environments with
    HSRP.</para>

    <para>This release now supports duplicate IP addresses. The nodes will not
    be merged and an event will be generated.</para>

    <para>Note that networks are not supposed to have duplicate IP addresses.
    In other words, if there are two "10.1.1.1" addresses on a network, and
    OpenNMS sends a "ping" to 10.1.1.1, it will assume that a response means
    that interface 10.1.1.1 is "up", regardless of which "10.1.1.1" interface
    responds.</para>

    <para>Since this feature was mainly written to support inactive or
    unreachable interfaces that were discovered by SNMP, this behavior should
    not present a problem, although it does have the added benefit of being
    able to monitor highly available IP addresses.</para>

    <para>For example, if your website lives at 10.1.1.1, which lives on two
    devices, as long as an HTTP request to 10.1.1.1 is answered (by either
    machine) OpenNMS will mark the service as up.</para>

    <bridgehead>New Asset Configuration "Categories"</bridgehead>

    <para>The rules uses in categories and filter rules, usually along the
    lines of <programlisting>&lt;rule&gt;IPADDR IPLIKE *.*.*.*&lt;/rule&gt;</programlisting>
    are actually quite flexible, and can be built on almost anything in the
    database. However it would be nice to easily place a particular device
    into a category for display on the main page, notifications, etc..</para>

    <para>There are four categories:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Display Category (database field displayCategory): This is to be
        used for grouping devices into a particular category.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Poller Category (database field pollerCategory): This is to be
        used to define devices in a particular poller package.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Notification Category (database field notifyCategory): This
        could be something like "serverAdmin" or "networkAdmin" to be used for
        directing notifications.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Threshold Category (database field thresholdCategory): This is
        to be used to define devices in a particular thresholding
        package.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Note that there is no "hard coded" meaning to these categories, you
    could use "poller" for "threshold" etc.. They are just labeled for
    convenience.</para>

    <para>How would you use them? Well, you would need to modify the
    &lt;filter&gt; or &lt;rule&gt; tags in the configuration files. Suppose
    you had two types of polling packages, like "Gold" and "Silver". You would
    then have a filter like &lt;filter&gt;pollerCategory ==
    "Gold"&lt;/filter&gt; for that package. By just adding the name "Gold" or
    "Silver" to the proper category on the asset screen you can place a
    particular device into that poller package.</para>

    <para>Note that once you have sorted all of your devices, you will need to
    restart OpenNMS for the poller to reload the proper configuration.</para>

    <bridgehead>Added an XML RPC daemon</bridgehead>

    <para>One user of OpenNMS has integrated it into their
    provisioning/billing/support package. They use multiple instances of
    OpenNMS to poll the services on their network, and all of these instances
    talk to a single database. By sending events to
    <filename>eventd</filename>, they can affect changes in how these devices
    are polled (without a restart).</para>

    <para>In order to alert this system to events from OpenNMS, like
    "nodeLostService", we send events out via
    <filename>xmlrpcd</filename>.</para>

    <para>Unfortunately, there is not time to describe in detail how this
    system works, but it will be documented as soon as possible (the hope is
    by 1.2).</para>

    <bridgehead>Support for Java 1.4.2</bridgehead>

    <para>People who used previous versions of OpenNMS on Java 1.4.2 found out
    that it would use up all of the resources on the system and then die. This
    turned out to be due to a very obscure bug in Java. The code was
    re-written to avoid this and now we recommend that OpenNMS is run on
    1.4.2.</para>

    <bridgehead>MIB Compiler for Data Collection</bridgehead>

    <para>John Rodriguez has created a great MIB Compiler to convert native
    MIB information into a format that can be used by
    datacollection-config.xml.</para>

    <para>We hope to import into the webUI in the future. But for now it is
    located in the <filename>contrib</filename> directory under
    <filename>mibparser</filename>.</para>

    <para>In that directory is the complete code (in Java) as well as a
    helpful README. In a nutshell this is how you would use it.</para>

    <para>Change into the dist directory and run the parseMib.sh wrapper
    script. The format is:</para>

    <para><computeroutput> Usage: parseMib.sh &lt;MIB File 1&gt; [&lt;MIB file
    2&gt;...] Example: parseMib.sh RFC-1213.my</computeroutput></para>

    <para>Thus:</para>

    <para><programlisting>$ ./parseMib.sh /usr/share/snmp/mibs/RFC1213-MIB.txt 
    Looking for a good java...
    Using java in user's path...
    Checking Java version for 1.4+...
    Version is: java version "1.4.2_04"

    Checking for JAVA_HOME...
    JAVA_HOME not set, trying to find it...
    JAVA_HOME set to: .
    Calling parser...</programlisting></para>

    <para>will generate output that is very familiar to people used to
    modifying datacollection-config.xml. For example:</para>

    <para><programlisting>&lt;mibObj oid=".1.3.6.1.2.1.11.1" instance="0" alias="snmpInPkts" type="Counter" /&gt;
&lt;mibObj oid=".1.3.6.1.2.1.11.2" instance="0" alias="snmpOutPkts" type="Counter" /&gt;
&lt;mibObj oid=".1.3.6.1.2.1.11.3" instance="0" alias="snmpInBadVersions" type="Counter" /&gt;
&lt;mibObj oid=".1.3.6.1.2.1.11.4" instance="0" alias="snmpInBadCommunityNamesTOOLONG" type="Counter" /&gt;
&lt;mibObj oid=".1.3.6.1.2.1.11.5" instance="0" alias="snmpInBadCommunityUsesTOOLONG" type="Counter" /&gt;
&lt;mibObj oid=".1.3.6.1.2.1.11.6" instance="0" alias="snmpInASNParseErrs" type="Counter" /&gt;
&lt;mibObj oid=".1.3.6.1.2.1.11.8" instance="0" alias="snmpInTooBigs" type="Counter" /&gt;
&lt;mibObj oid=".1.3.6.1.2.1.11.9" instance="0" alias="snmpInNoSuchNames" type="Counter" /&gt;</programlisting></para>

    <para>This could be put into a new MIB group,
    <filename>snmp-stats</filename> or some such, directly without having to
    explore the MIB by hand.</para>

    <para>I love this app.</para>

    <para>There are some caveats. In using this I have sometimes seen errors
    where the MIB compiler could not find a referenced variable because it is
    defined in another MIB file. Simply list it first in the list of MIBs to
    parse.</para>

    <para>I have also come across some MIBs that define custom object types
    and the parser does not handle it all that well. It is often possible just
    to delete the offending line from the MIB file (after making a copy of
    course) and try it again.</para>

    <para>OpenNMS can only handle numeric data types, or DisplayStrings that
    can be converted into numbers, so keep that in mind when choosing which
    values to collect.</para>

    <para>We use RRDTool, and RRDTool has a 19 character limit on filenames
    (the part before <filename>.rrd</filename>). Since the "alias" field
    becomes the file name, you cannot have an alias longer than 19 characters.
    The parser will append "TOOLONG" to overlength aliases, and you can edit
    them by hand (it would be possible to truncate the name, but you cannot
    have duplicate aliases and that might occur).</para>

    <para>Finally, OpenNMS can handle a numeric instance (0, 1, 2, ... etc.)
    or an instance of "ifIndex". So an instance of
    "<filename>tcpConnState</filename>" would cause an error.</para>

    <bridgehead>New Build System</bridgehead>

    <para>Our goal is to make OpenNMS as pure Java as possible. However, for a
    variety of reasons we cannot do that yet. When OpenNMS was started,
    <filename>ant</filename> (the program used to build other Java programs)
    had limitations that had to be worked around. This resulted in a workable,
    but somewhat confusing, build system.</para>

    <para>DJ Gregor (building on work started by Edwin Buck) rebuilt the build
    system, making it almost pure <filename>ant</filename>. This was great for
    those doing development, so hats off to Deej and Edwin.</para>

    <bridgehead>New NTP Poller</bridgehead>

    <para>Mike Huot has written a new NTP poller. You will notice it in
    capsd-configuration.xml and poller-configuration.xml. Hat off to
    Mike.</para>

    <bridgehead>Nice Little Things</bridgehead>

    <para>Small additions that deserve mention:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>APC data collection was added.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Added "maxval" and "minval" attributed to the
          <filename>mibObj</filename> definition in
          <filename>datacollection-config.xml</filename> to help eliminate
          spikes.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Started improving start up times on large systems.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Added a sort to KSC reports.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Added an initial delay to notification paths.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

    <bridgehead>Bug Fixes</bridgehead>

    <para>We have lots of bug fixes. I am really tired. Check out the <ulink

  </section>

  <section id="chap2sect1">
    <title>Changes in OpenNMS 1.1.2 and Above</title>

    <para>The following features were added in 1.1.2:</para>

    <bridgehead>Poller Improvements</bridgehead>

    <para>There are three new pollers available:</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Ssh:</emphasis> Previously, the SSH service
    was polled and discovered using the generic TCP class. This worked fine,
    except that SSH expects a version to be sent with the query. This causes
    numerous logs, thus the TCP class was modified into an SSH class that
    sends the correct version string.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">JDBC:</emphasis> The database pollers also use
    the TCP class to connect to well known ports. Jose Nunez Vicente Zuleta
    created a poller that uses the particular JDBC database driver to make a
    connection, get the system catelogs, and if successful, mark the database
    service as "up". Since this requires a valid username and password that
    can access the database, it is not the default class, but it is pretty
    simple to set up.</para>

    <para>In order to automatically detect and monitor databases, a few
    changes need to be made to both the network and the OpenNMS configuration.
    First, be sure that the username and password you plan to use actually
    works from the OpenNMS server. This will involve changes to pg_hba.conf
    for PostgreSQL, and I am not sure about others.</para>

    <para>Second, you will need to insure that you have a jar file with the
    JDBC driver for your particular database. Copy it to $OPENNMS_HOME/lib
    (the one for PostgreSQL is already included).</para>

    <para>Okay, now you need to modify the capsd configuration to discover the
    service and modify the poller configuration to poll the service.</para>

    <para>capsd: Here is an example for Sybase:</para>

    <para><programlisting>&lt;protocol-plugin protocol="Sybase-JDBC" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.capsd.JDBCPlugin" scan="on"&gt;
        &lt;property key="user" value="sa"/&gt;
        &lt;property key="password" value="XXXX"/&gt;
        &lt;property key="retry" value="3"/&gt;
        &lt;property key="timeout" value="5000"/&gt;
        &lt;property key="driver" value="com.sybase.jdbc2.jdbc.SybDriver"/&gt;
        &lt;!-- jdbc:sybase:Tds::/ --&gt;
        &lt;property key="url" value="jdbc:sybase:Tds:OPENNMS_JDBC_HOSTNAME:4100/tempdb"/&gt;
&lt;/protocol-plugin&gt;</programlisting></para>

    <para>and one for MySql:<programlisting>&lt;protocol-plugin protocol="MySQL-JDBC" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.capsd.JDBCPlugin" scan="on"&gt;
        &lt;property key="user" value="root"/&gt;
        &lt;property key="password" value="XXXX"/&gt;
        &lt;property key="retry" value="3"/&gt;
        &lt;property key="timeout" value="5000"/&gt;
        &lt;property key="driver" value="org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver"/&gt;
        &lt;!-- jdbc:mysql://[&lt;:3306&gt;]/ --&gt;
        &lt;property key="url" value="jdbc:mysql://OPENNMS_JDBC_HOSTNAME:3306/mysql"/&gt;
&lt;/protocol-plugin&gt;</programlisting></para>

    <para>and one for PostgreSQL:</para>

    <programlisting>&lt;protocol-plugin protocol="PostgreSQL-JDBC" class-name="org.opennms.netmgt.capsd.JDBCPlugin" scan="on"&gt;
        &lt;property key="user" value="opennms"/&gt;
        &lt;property key="password" value="opennms"/&gt;
        &lt;property key="retry" value="3"/&gt;
        &lt;property key="timeout" value="5000"/&gt;
        &lt;property key="driver" value="org.postgresql.Driver"/&gt;
        &lt;!-- jdbc:postgresql:[[:&lt;5432&gt;/]] --&gt;
        &lt;property key="url" value="jdbc:postgresql://OPENNMS_JDBC_HOSTNAME:5432/opennms"/&gt; 
&lt;/protocol-plugin&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>Note that the service names for all three of these examples have
    "-JDBC" added to the end of their names. This means you can run them
    separately from the standard database protocols, or if you like, you can
    completely replace the standard protocols. In fact, if you wish, you can
    use the standard port check in capsd, and then use the JDBC poller
    configuration to do the actual polling.</para>

    <para>Here are the poller configuration examples:</para>

    <programlisting>    &lt;service name="Sybase-JDBC" user-defined="false" interval="6000" status="on"&gt;
        &lt;parameter key="user" value="sa"/&gt;
        &lt;parameter key="password" value="XXXX"/&gt;
        &lt;parameter key="timeout" value="3000"/&gt;
        &lt;parameter key="driver" value="com.sybase.jdbc2.jdbc.SybDriver"/&gt;
        &lt;!-- jdbc:sybase:Tds::/ --&gt;
        &lt;parameter key="url" value="jdbc:sybase:Tds:OPENNMS_JDBC_HOSTNAME:4100/tempdb"/&gt;
    &lt;/service&gt;</programlisting>

    <programlisting>    &lt;service name="MySQL-JDBC" user-defined="false" interval="6000" status="on"&gt;
        &lt;parameter key="user" value="root"/&gt;
        &lt;parameter key="password" value="XXXX"/&gt;
        &lt;parameter key="timeout" value="3000"/&gt;
        &lt;parameter key="driver" value="org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver"/&gt;
        &lt;!-- jdbc:mysql://[&lt;:3306&gt;]/ --&gt;
        &lt;parameter key="url" value="jdbc:mysql:// OPENNMS_JDBC_HOSTNAME:3306/mysql"/&gt;
    &lt;/service&gt;</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">General Purpose Script Poller:</emphasis> Bill
    Ayres has written a poller that will execute a script, and based on the
    response from that script it will mark the service as being "up" or
    "down", called the "General Purpose" or "Gp" Poller. He has used it to
    monitor RADIUS servers, for example.</para>

    <para>GpPlugin and GpMonitor work much like TcpPlugin and TcpMonitor in
    that you can use them to define as many custom services as you need, each
    with a unique service name.</para>

    <para>GpPlugin and GpMonitor call an external script or program to test a
    particular service. The script will be passed the IP address of the
    interface OpenNMS is testing ( as --hostname [IP Address]), followed by
    the timeout (as --timeout [timeout]), followed by any optional arguments
    that may need to passed.</para>

    <para>The script is expected to return a string as standard output which
    is then compared to the banner property or parameter to determine success
    or failure of the test.</para>

    <para>The timeout is implemented in GpPlugin and GpMonitor. However, some
    scripts may want to know how long OpenNMS is going to wait for a reply, so
    the timeout value is passed to the script, and can be ignored by the
    script if it is not needed.</para>

    <para>GpPlugin and GpMonitor also check the exit status of the script or
    program. If it is not zero, then the test fails. They will also gather and
    log any standard error output from the script, but the presence of error
    output does not prevent the test from succeeding if the banner matches the
    standard output.</para>

    <para>Example poller parameters are shown below. All of these are optional
    except script, which is required, and will cause an exception to be logged
    if it is missing.</para>

    <para>Example plugin properties are also shown below. All of these are
    optional except script, which is required, and will cause an exception to
    be logged if it is missing.</para>

    <para>These programs use the exec method from Java's Runtime class. Exec
    is known to have pitfalls. (See <ulink
    url="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-2000/jw-1229-traps.html">When
    Runtime.exec() won't</ulink>) Also, exec does not have a built-in timeout
    feature. In deciding what to do about these shortcomings, Bill discovered
    that Scott McCrory has already done it with his ExecRunner class.
    ExecRunner and StreamGobbler are at <ulink
    url="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</ulink> as part of <ulink
    url="http://spumoni.sourceforge.net/">Spumoni</ulink>.</para>

    <para>One more word about the timeout. ExecRunner expects the timeout in
    integer seconds, not milliseconds, and a value of zero means wait
    indefinitely. To avoid confusion, Bill maintained the OpenNMS practice of
    specifying the timeout in milliseconds. Before passing it on to
    ExecRunner, it gets converted to seconds in the following manner: Zero
    remains zero, 1 thru 1999 gets converted to 1 second, 2000 thru 2999 -&gt;
    2 seconds, 3000 thru 3999 -&gt; 3 seconds, etc..</para>

    <para>Included in contrib is a simple perl test script,
    <filename>gptest.pl</filename>, that is handy for testing, since it is
    easy to edit and change its behaviour.</para>

    <para>To implement Gp, add the following entries, substituting your

    <bridgehead>Script Daemon</bridgehead>

    <para>Speaking of scripts, Jim Doble has written a daemon that will
    execute scripts based on events received or generated by OpenNMS, called
    ScriptD. This process, governed as usual from a configuration file, allows
    one to generally or specifically execute actions based on events in
    OpenNMS.</para>

    <para>The scripting language, as I understand it, is <ulink
    url="http://www.beanshell.org/">beanshell</ulink>. As Jim writes:
    <quote>You will notice that BeanShell is a lot like Java, but with some
    relaxed syntax. For example you do not have to define types for your
    variables, and attributes for which there are simple get methods can be
    accessed as properties (i.e. you can say event.uei or event.getUei()
    interchangably.) </quote></para>

    <para>There are 4 types of scripts that can be run: start-script,
    reload-script, stop-script, and event-script. When ScriptD starts it will
    run all of the commands in the <varname>&lt;start-script&gt;</varname>
    tags. Likewise, when ScriptD stops, it will run all of the commands in the
    <varname>&lt;stop-script&gt;</varname> tags. Also, there is a new event,
    <varname>uei.opennms.org/internal/reloadScriptConfig</varname>, which when
    received will run all of the <varname>&lt;reload-script&gt;</varname>
    tags.</para>

    <para>The final script type, <varname>&lt;event-script&gt;</varname> gets
    run when events are received. Event scripts can have one or more UEI
    elements, which specify the UEI's for which that script should run. If no
    UEI element is present, the script will run for all events.</para>

    <para>The scripts can make use of the <varname>SnmpTrapHelper</varname>
    class, which is a utility to make it easier to manipulate traps from a
    script.</para>

    <para>There is an example <filename>scriptd-configuration.xml
    </filename>file included in the <filename>$OPENNMS_HOME/etc</filename>
    directory.</para>

    <para>If you want to forward all SNMP traps to another machine as an SNMP
    trap, you would use the following event script:</para>

    <programlisting>        &lt;event-script language="beanshell"&gt;

                import org.opennms.core.utils.ThreadCategory;
                import org.apache.log4j.Category;

                ThreadCategory.setPrefix("scriptd-event");
                Category log = ThreadCategory.getInstance();

                event = bsf.lookupBean("event");

                if (event.snmp != null) {
                        log.debug("forwarding a trap");
                        snmpTrapHelper.forwardTrap(event, "10.1.1.1", 162);
                }

        &lt;/event-script&gt;</programlisting>

    <para>This will forward the trap to 10.1.1.1, port 162. Note that the
    event will have SNMP information if the event is indeed an SNMP trap.
    Since internal OpenNMS events do not, you could use that to forward
    OpenNMS events as an SNMP trap to another system:</para>

    <programlisting>&lt;event-script language="beanshell"&gt;

        import org.opennms.core.utils.ThreadCategory;
        import org.apache.log4j.Category;

        ThreadCategory.setPrefix("scriptd-event");
        Category log = ThreadCategory.getInstance();

        event = bsf.lookupBean("event");

    <bridgehead>Maps</bridgehead>

    <para>Okay, let us get this out in the open. I do not care for maps in
    network management. Yes, they are nice looking, but truely useful maps
    cannot be automated, and the manual process of generating maps takes more
    time than they are worth.</para>

    <para>That said, my opinions do not mean much in this project (grin) and
    if someone is willing to put in some work and write solid code I am more
    than willing to accept it. Thus, Derek Glidden decided to go and write a
    mapping system for OpenNMS.</para>

    <para>This will display the nodes as icons, and the current availability
    is displayed in color underneath it. You can view it in a tree mode or
    just as a list of icons, and the image will automatically refresh. The
    parenting relationships have to be manually set.</para>

    <para>The image is built and displayed using Scalable Vector Graphics
    (SVG). I think this is a great decision, but the downside is that the only
    SVG viewer I was able to get to work was from Adobe for Internet Explorer
    on Windows. I was not able to get SVG to work with Mozilla or Safari (on
    Mac). Using the system on IE was very clean and fast.</para>

    <para>There is the option to convert the SVG image to a PNG image. This is
    extremely processor intensive, takes a long time on a network of any size,
    and often fails. It is not recommended.</para>

    <para>Scared yet? (grin)</para>

    <para>For these reasons I am treating the current map implementation as
    contributed code (i.e. not supported). It is hoped, however, that Derek
    and others will work to make more improvements to the system.</para>

    <para>Okay, to get started, read the <filename>map.disable</filename> file
    in <filename>$OPENNMS_HOME/etc</filename>. You will need to copy this file
    to <filename>map.enable</filename>. This will add a "Map" menu item in the
    WebUI.</para>

    <para>You will also have to make some changes to the tomcat4
    configuration. First, you need to set <varname>headless</varname> equal to
    <varname>true</varname>, and second you should probably increase the
    memory available to Tomcat (especially if you are trying to use the SVG to
    PNG transcoder). <varname>OutOfMemory</varname> exceptions in Tomcat are
    indicative of a too small memory setting when trying to render the
    map.</para>

    <para>I know this whole things sounds a bit negative, but that is no
    reflection on Derek's work. He wrote very clean code and I like the
    architecture (SVG especially) that he came up with. The icons are cool,
    too. So hats off to Derek.</para>

    <para>But I am bracing myself for the onslaught of questions like
    <quote>"Can I add a background?"</quote>, <quote>"Can I change the icons
    based on systemOID?"</quote>, and <quote>"Can I make submaps?"</quote>.
    Patience, please.</para>

  <section id="chap2sect2">
    <title>Changes in OpenNMS 1.1.1 and Above</title>

    <para>The following features were added in 1.1.1:</para>

    <bridgehead>Trap Handling</bridgehead>

    <para>SNMP Traps will now be associated with nodes if the IP address in
    the trap matches a known IP address in the database.</para>

    <para>If the IP Address is not known, OpenNMS will generate a newSuspect
    event to attempt to discover the device. This behavior can be disabled in
    the trapd-configuration.xml file.</para>

    <para>Added new trap definitions for Dell OpenManage, Foundry Networks and
    ADIC. Also added an updated mib2opennms program which improves the look of
    the output.</para>

    <bridgehead>Reports</bridgehead>

    <para>Added a new custom reporting module which allows one to create and
    save custom performance reports. It is called the Key SNMP Custom (KSC)
    Reporting Tool.</para>

    <para>Added buttons on the standard Performance and Response Time pages to
    allow the range to be changed between the last Day/Week/Month/Year.</para>

    <bridgehead>Response Time</bridgehead>

    <para>Added the ability to collect response time on the following pollers:
    Citrix, FTP, HTTPS, IMAP, POP3, SMTP and TCP.</para>

    <para>The RRAs for Response Time data are now part of the poller
    configuration file.</para>

    <bridgehead>Web Improvements</bridgehead>

    <para>There is now a Response Time link on the node and interface
    pages.</para>

    <para>If a node or interface supports HTTP, there is now a link to that
    service.</para>

    <para>Added a two minute refresh to the event listing page.</para>

    <bridgehead>Other Features</bridgehead>

    <para>Added non-blocking I/O to the HTTPS service. Now all monitors and
    plug-ins should be non-blocking.</para>

    <para>If you set the IP Address in a poll-outages calendar to "match-any"
    it will match all addresses in the poller package that uses that
    calendar.</para>

    <para>Increased the size of the contactinfo field in the usersnotified
    table, and changed create.sql to make this easier.</para>

    <bridgehead>Fixed Bugs</bridgehead>

    <para>Fixed numerous bugs, including 650 where "down" events could be
    written to the database after the corresponding "up" event. See the
    CHANGELOG for a full list.</para>

    <bridgehead>Tomcat4</bridgehead>

    <para>For a variety of reasons, OpenNMS 1.1.1 and beyond will require
    Tomcat4 version 4.1.18 or higher.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="chap2sect3">
    <title>Changes in OpenNMS 1.1.0 and Above</title>

    <para>There were many changes to OpenNMS between 1.0 and 1.1. Here are a
    few listed by functional area.</para>

    <bridgehead>Events and Event Handling</bridgehead>

    <para>The events and notifications part of OpenNMS saw the most changes
    with 1.1.0. First, there was a new tag added to the
    <filename>eventconf.xml</filename> file called &lt;event-file&gt;. This
    allows for external files to be included in the event
    configuration.</para>

    <para>Also, the order in which events appear is now strictly enforced.
    When trying to match an event with an event definition, OpenNMS takes the
    first match. The events in the <filename>eventconf.xml</filename> are read
    first, followed by the files identified by &lt;event-file&gt; tags (in the
    order in which they are listed). In the configuration that ships with
    OpenNMS, the file with the default events is loaded last. Be sure to add
    any custom files before that one.</para>

    <para>Prior to this release, the SNMP generic traps 0-5 (coldStart,
    warmStart, linkDown, etc.) were hard-coded. Now they must be defined (and
    that definition is included in the default events file), but this allows
    for generic traps other than type 6 to be configured differently for, say,
    different hosts.</para>

    <para>Speaking of event files, over 2750 events were added out of the box,
    including those from vendors such as Cisco, HP and 3Com. Please let us
    know if anything is misconfigured or if we need to add some events.</para>

    <para>The ability to configure events based on parameters (varbinds) was
    also added. This is best demonstrated with an example. In the new HP event
    definitions there is an event called hpicfFaultFinderTrap. It is defined
    as: <programlisting>&lt;event&gt; 
    &lt;mask&gt;
        &lt;maskelement&gt; 
            &lt;mename&gt;id&lt;/mename&gt;
            &lt;mevalue&gt;.1.3.6.1.4.1.11.2.14.12.1&lt;/mevalue&gt;
        &lt;/maskelement&gt; 
        &lt;maskelement&gt;
            &lt;mename&gt;generic&lt;/mename&gt;
            &lt;mevalue&gt;6&lt;/mevalue&gt; &lt;/maskelement&gt;
        &lt;maskelement&gt; 
            &lt;mename&gt;specific&lt;/mename&gt;
            &lt;mevalue&gt;5&lt;/mevalue&gt; 
        &lt;/maskelement&gt;
    &lt;/mask&gt;
    &lt;uei&gt;uei.opennms.org/vendor/HP/traps/hpicfFaultFinderTrap&lt;/uei&gt;

    &lt;severity&gt;Warning&lt;/severity&gt; 
&lt;/event&gt;
      </programlisting></para>

    <para>Note that the third parameter denotes the severity of the event. By
    default this event has a severity of Warning, but what if it was desired
    to make the "critical" event a severity of Major? Using the new varbind
    extension to the mask tag: <programlisting>&lt;event&gt;

    &lt;/descr&gt; 
    &lt;logmsg dest='logndisplay'&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP Event: ICF Hub Fault Found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/logmsg&gt;
    &lt;severity&gt;Major&lt;/severity&gt; &lt;/event&gt;
      </programlisting></para>

    <para>This event, when added before the previous event since it is more
    specific, will try to match on the enterprise id, the generic trap value
    of 6, the specific trap value of 5 <emphasis>and</emphasis> the value of
    the third parameter, or varbind, of 3.</para>

    <para>There was also the addition of a low and high threshold rearm
    events. When a threshold is exceeded in consecutive polls equal to the
    trigger number, the threshold event is generated. Another event will not
    be generated until the polled value drops below the rearm number. The
    rearm event is thus similar to a "cleared" event. Since the first
    parameter passed with the threshold event is the data source name, using
    the "varbind" tag above, each data source can now have its own
    event.</para>

    <para>One of the more noticeable changes is that the Unique Event
    Identifier no longer contains "http://". The original intent was that the
    UEI would act something like an XML namespace, but in practice it is just
    a label, so the "http://" was removed to avoid confusion.</para>

    <para>Notifications also received some attention with this release. Due to
    popular demand, the tags %nodelabel% and %interfaceresolve% are now
    available. The former will display the label of the nodeid associated with
    the event, and the latter will attempt to resolve the name associated with
    the IP Address of the interface of the event.</para>

    <para>In <filename>notifd-configuration.xml</filename> there are now two
    new attributes. In the global properties, there is "match-all". By
    default, this is set to false, which means that the first notification
    that matches an event will be the only notification sent. If it is set to
    true, then all notifications that match a given event will be sent.
    (Thanks Nick) In the auto-acknowledge section, there is a new attribute
    called "clear". By adding "clear=true" to the auto-acknowledge tag, both
    the event being auto acknowledged <emphasis>and</emphasis> the event that
    caused the acknowledgement will be acknowledged. Thus the "up" event that
    clears a "down" will also be cleared.</para>

    <para>In addition to these enhancements, various bugs were fixed.
    Notification rules now actually work, and you can filter node level events
    via IP address. Also, threshold events can now generate
    notifications.</para>

    <bridgehead>Polling</bridgehead>

    <para>The biggest change to polling would have to be the addition of
    response time information for DHCP, DNS, HTTP and ICMP based pollers.
    Similar to data collection, the response time information can be graphed
    and it can have threshold alarms placed on it.</para>

    <para>Also, all of the plugins and monitors (except HTTPS) have been
    re-written to use the non-blocking I/O available in the 1.4 JDK.</para>

    <bridgehead>Discovery</bridgehead>

    <para>There has been some discussion on how OpenNMS determines node
    labels. Currently, this is set to the resolved SNMP Primary Interface IP
    Address. However, it is common practice on routers to have a
    software-loopback address. OpenNMS will now discover such interfaces (as
    long as they do not have an address that starts with 127) and mark them as
    the primary SNMP Interface. Note that no services will be polled on such
    interfaces.</para>

    <bridgehead>The Web User Interface</bridgehead>

    <para>A few changes were made to the WebUI. There is now a
    webui-colors.xml file that will allow for dynamic changes to the
    background colors used in the categories list on the main page (more pages
    to follow). Also under "Admin" the ability to delete nodes was
    added.</para>

    <para>In addition, there is a new Admin page that will allow one to choose
    which non-IP interfaces will be used in data collection. By setting the
    snmpStorageFlag in <filename>datacollection-config.xml</filename> to
    "select" (now the default), OpenNMS will only store data from those
    interfaces that could serve as a primary SNMP interface. One can then
    select which other interfaces to collect on using the GUI. The previous
    values of snmpStorageFlag ("primary" and "all") still work.</para>

    <para>Also, the "Destination Path" interface now has the ability to choose
    NOT to include a service (thanks Nick) which will create a rule like
    "match the events where service is NOT FTP", and by placing the mouse over
    the categories on the main page, the last time the category was updated
    should be displayed.</para>

    <bridgehead>Fixed Service Deletion in Downtime Model</bridgehead>

    <para>The poller downtime model allows for a service to be deleted if it
    has been down for a certain amount of time. This did not work correctly
    and has been fixed.</para>

    <bridgehead>Reduced the Amount of Data Initially Collected from the
    ifTable</bridgehead>

    <para>During discovery, the ifTable is collected from each device that is
    found to support SNMP. On some HP switches, this would fail due to a
    limitation on the SNMP maximum packet size. All non-essential ifTable
    elements were removed from the request that appears to resolve the
    problem.</para>

    <bridgehead>Removed Spaces in Notification Path Names</bridgehead>

    <para>Spaces in Notification Path names have been known to cause problems.
    The Web UI was modified to disallow spaces in path names. Bug 657.</para>

    <bridgehead>Fixed the AM/PM Ordering on Performance Report
    UI.</bridgehead>

    <para>In the Custom Performance Report Web UI, 11 PM was followed by 12
    PM, when it should have been 12 AM. This has been corrected. Bug
    515.</para>

    <bridgehead>Added a "contrib" Directory</bridgehead>

    <para>The "contrib" directory now contains code, such as nifty utilities,
    that exists outside of the main OpenNMS source but may prove useful. One
    such example is Tomas Carlsson's "mib2opennms" program. These programs are
    not supported.</para>

    <bridgehead>Removed Duplicate Entries in
    <filename>capsd-configuration.xml</filename></bridgehead>

    <para>Both LDAP and Citrix protocol plug-ins were listed twice. This would
    slow down the capabilities scan considerably.</para>

    <bridgehead>Updated Data Collection and Graphing</bridgehead>

    <para>Added new entries to <filename>datacollection-config.xml</filename>
    and <filename>snmp-graph.properties</filename>.</para>

    <bridgehead>Bugfixes</bridgehead>

    <para>Many bugfixes, including allowing Threshold events to generate
    notifications, AdminStatus and OperStatus values causing exceptions, and
    rescans with certain devices.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="chap2sect4">
    <title>Changes in OpenNMS 1.0.0 and Above</title>

    <para>The following major changes occurred between 0.9.9 and 1.0.0:</para>

    <bridgehead>"OpenSSH" service is now "SSH"</bridgehead>

    <para>The OpenSSH service has been renamed to "SSH" and changed to detect
    common versions of SSH servers other than OpenSSH. Upgrades will retain
    the "OpenSSH" service as well for the sake of reports.</para>

    <bridgehead>"Service Unresponsive" support</bridgehead>

    <para>There is now the possibility of having a state between "up" and
    "down" that flags a service as being unresponsive. This state can be
    reached when the service's port can be connected to, but it does not
    respond in a reasonable amount of time.</para>

    <bridgehead>Bugfixes</bridgehead>

    <para>Many small bugfixes, including the "Calculating..." problem if RTC
    has not come up yet when tomcat starts.</para>
