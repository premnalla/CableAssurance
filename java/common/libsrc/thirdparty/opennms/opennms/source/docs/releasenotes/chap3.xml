  <subtitle>Known Problems And Workarounds In This Release</subtitle>

  <para>Here is the list of known issues in this release of OpenNMS.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Invalid Symbolic Link on Some Distros</title>

    <para>On Mandrake 10, and perhaps others, the symbolic link created in
    <filename>/etc/init.d</filename> for opennms doesn't seem to work. Do the
    following:</para>

    <para><programlisting># rm /etc/init.d/opennms
# ln -s /opt/OpenNMS/bin/opennms.sh /etc/init.d/opennms</programlisting></para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>The Installer is No Longer Automatic as of 1.1.5</title>

    <para>I expect this to be the biggest question on the discussion lists. As
    of 1.1.5, the installer must be run manually after the packages are
    installed. Please see the <ulink
    url="https://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=23937&amp;group_id=4141">documentation</ulink>
    for more information.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Special Note for KSC Report Users</title>

    <para>With 1.1.5 a new format has been created for SNMP graphs in the
    snmp-graph.properties file. An attempt has been made to organize the
    different reports, and so default reports like "bits" are now prefixed by
    "mib2" (i.e. the report is now mib2.bits).</para>

    <para>If you have KSC reports on bits, errors, etc., you will need to edit
    the <filename>ksc-performance-reports.xml</filename> file and replace the
    old names with the new ones.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Necessary Changes to Tomcat for 1.1.4 for Upgrades</title>

    <para>In 1.1.4 the way OpenNMS configures Tomcat4 has changed. All of the
    necessary configuration information is now in opennms.xml in the Tomcat4
    webapps directory.</para>

    <para>Unfortunately, if you are upgrading, there are two things you will
    have to manually do in order to get OpenNMS to work correctly.</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Remove the <filename>opennms</filename> directory (or symbolic
        link) from the <filename>$TOMCAT4_HOME/webapps</filename>
        directory.</para>

        <para>Depending on your operating system, you will need to find the
        <filename>webapps</filename> directory (usually
        <filename>/var/tomcat4/webapps)</filename>. In that directory should
        be an <filename>opennms.xml</filename> file and an
        <filename>opennms</filename> directory (or symlink). Remove it and
        leave just the <filename>opennms.xml</filename> file.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Locate the server.xml file, usually in $TOMCAT4_HOME/conf
        directory (/var/tomcat4/conf for many distributions). Remove the four
        &lt;context&gt; lines that refer to OpenNMS:</para>

        <para><programlisting>      &lt;Context path="/opennms" docBase="opennms" debug="0" reloadable="true"&gt;
        &lt;Logger className="org.opennms.web.log.Log4JLogger" homeDir="/opt/OpenNMS"/&gt;
        &lt;Realm className="org.opennms.web.authenticate.OpenNMSTomcatRealm" homeDir="/opt/OpenNMS"/&gt;
      &lt;/Context &gt;</programlisting></para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>You should then be able to restart Tomcat and everything should work
    just fine. Note that this does not apply to new installs, just
    upgrades.</para>
  </section>

    <title>New Requirements for Tomcat and PostgreSQL</title>

    <para>Version 1.1.2 and beyond of OpenNMS will require at a minimum Tomcat
    version 4.1.18 and PostgreSQL 7.2. OpenNMS will no longer supply "onms"
    versions of these applications, and instead will use main distributions
    from their maintainers.</para>

    <para>Note that upgrading these programs is not simple.</para>

    <bridgehead>Tomcat4</bridgehead>

    <para>For Tomcat, the best thing to do is uninstall version 4.0 and then
    install 4.1. Version 4.1 is not seen as an upgrade to 4.0, but is instead
    seen as a separate product by rpm and apt. You will need to make the
    following changes to the tomcat4.conf file (located in /etc/tomcat4 on Red
    Hat):</para>

    <programlisting># you could also override JAVA_HOME here
# Where your java installation lives
# JAVA_HOME="/usr/java/jdk"
# JAVA_HOME="/opt/IBMJava2-131"
JAVA_HOME="[location of your Java Home dir]"

# What user should run tomcat
TOMCAT_USER="root"</programlisting>

    <para>You do not have to run Tomcat as root if you change the permissions
    on <filename>$OPENNMS/logs</filename> and
    <filename>$OPENNMS/etc</filename> so that the Tomcat user can write to
    them.</para>

    <bridgehead>PostgreSQL</bridgehead>

    <para>Two main changes need to be made to the Postgres configuration in
    order to allow OpenNMS to access it properly. Postgres needs to have been
    started at least once to create the "data" directory that will contain the
    configuration files.</para>

    <para>Edit <filename>postgresql.conf</filename> (located in
    <filename>/var/pgsql/data</filename> on Red Hat) and insure the following
    values exist:<programlisting> tcpip_socket = true 
 max_connections = 256
 shared_buffers = 1024 </programlisting></para>

    <para>Edit <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> (host based authentication) to
    allow all users to access the database from the local host by
    un-commenting and/or adding these lines (do not add the last line if your
    system does not support IPv6):</para>

    <para><programlisting># TYPE  DATABASE    USER        IP-ADDRESS        IP-MASK           METHOD

local   all         all                                             trust
host    all         all         127.0.0.1         255.255.255.255   trust
host    all         all         ::1               ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff    trust</programlisting></para>

    <para>and you may need to uncomment:</para>

    <programlisting># Using sockets credentials for improved security. Not available everywhere,
# but works on Linux, *BSD (and probably some others)

# local  all    all             ident   sameuser</programlisting>

    <para>Note that this opens up Postgres to all users on the system (as long
    as they know the database password). Contact your database administrator
    if you want to limit this to a specific user, like root.</para>
