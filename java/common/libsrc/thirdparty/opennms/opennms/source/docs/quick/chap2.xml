		For purposes of this quick start guide, it is assumed that the web 
		installer will be installing and configuring most of your dependencies.  
		you may want to make sure that some packages are not installed 
		prior to beginning the web installer, in order to insure correct 
		configuration.

		<title>Uninstalling Preconfigured Software</title>
		<para>
			If you would like to install and configure dependency software on your machine, 
			you may want to use the OpenNMS Installation Guide.  Otherwise we will begin by checking for 
			already installed software that may not be configured to run with OpenNMS.

		<para>
			The packages we need to insure are not already installed are listed below, along 
			with a command line to test whether or not the RPMs are currently installed.

			The JDK package is necessary for building from source <emphasis>and</emphasis>
			for running OpenNMS with the Tomcat web interface, because the compiler
			components of the JDK are used to turn JSP web pages into Java at runtime.
			The environment variable JAVA_HOME should be set to /usr/java/j2sdk1.4.0 or the
			directory where it was installed.
