		<title>Installing OpenNMS from the Web Installer</title>
		<para>
			To install or upgrade on a supported RPM platform, run, as root: 
		</para>
		<programlisting>
	lynx -source http://install.opennms.org | sh
		</programlisting>
		<para>
			NOTE: It has been noticed that in some cases, the install script will "hang"
			after it has completed installing the OpenNMS RPMs.  The only thing left to be done 
			at this point is to install the documentation.  If you notice this condition 
			during your install you can safely use &lt;ctrl&gt;C to break out of the script.
		</para>
		<para>
			At that point you can either run the script again, and the documentation will 
			be installed, or simply verify that OpenNMS was installed by typing ...
			<programlisting>
	rpm -qa | grep -i opennms
			</programlisting>

		<title>Post installation</title>
		<para>
			After installing OpenNMS using the web installer, you will need to log out and 
			log back in as root, this will allow the setup of important environment environment
			variables.  Possibly the most important of these being $OPENNMS_HOME which will be set 
			to /opt/OpenNMS by default.
