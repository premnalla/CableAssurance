		<title>Adding Addresses</title>
		<para>
			Next we must define address(es) to be polled and service(s) to be monitored.
			The configuration files for OpenNMS are in the $OPENNMS_HOME/etcdirectory.  
			These files can be edited with vi or most any other *nix text editor.  Most 
			 of the files in the etc directory are in XML format, and should be fairly
			intuitive. (This is strictly a matter of opinion though I guess.)
		</para>
		<para>
			The first task is assigning addresses.  We will start by setting up a discovery
			range.  This is done in discovery-configuration.xml, and should look similar to
			the following ...
			<programlisting>
	&lt;include-range retries="2" timeout="3000"&gt;
	&lt;begin&gt;192.168.0.1&lt;/begin&gt;
	&lt;end&gt;192.168.0.254&lt;/end&gt;
	&lt;/include-range&gt;
			</programlisting>
			Next we want to ensure that the pollers are aware of this range of addresses.  
			This is done in poller-configuration.xml.
			<programlisting>
	&lt;include-range begin="192.168.0.1" end="192.168.0.254"/&gt;
			</programlisting>
			Note: you may also want to ensure that your network has a management-policy of 
			managed in capsd-configuration.xml.  Default configuration is managed for all 
			non-local, valid ip addresses.

		<title>Other Configurations</title>
		<para>
			There are many other files in the etc directory that you may wish to make changes to, 
			in order to achieve your desired results.  Some of the more common things you may want to 
			configure are as follows.
