  <subtitle>About This Release</subtitle>

  <para>Before 1.2.6 had time to really get out there, an issue was discovered
  with using the new SNMPv1 and SNMPv2 services. This was corrected, and since
  1.2.6 had not been formally released, but had been tagged, the fixed release
  was labeled 1.2.7.</para>

  <para>The code word for 1.2.7 is "birdshot".</para>

  <para>OpenNMS 1.2.6 is another release in the stable, or production, branch
  of OpenNMS. It fixes at least one annoying bug and adds a number of new
  features designed to increase usability, speed and functionality.</para>

  <para>The code word for 1.2.6 is "geneva".</para>

  <para>Release 1.2.5 is a maintenance release for the stable branch of
  OpenNMS. It includes a fix for the "opennms status", "opennms stop", and
  "opennms restart" commands being broken when using Java 5.0 due to a problem
  with getting status information from the running OpenNMS daemon. Users will
  need to re-install the etc/service-configuration.xml file due to some
  changed class names inside of MX4J. See Bug #1330.</para>

  <para>Release 1.2.5 is an important maintenance release for the stable
  branch of OpenNMS. It includes a major bug fix concerning possible polling
  deadlocks that can cause outages that are never resolved, as well as a large
  improvement to SNMP data collection speed and startup time.</para>

  <para>The code word for 1.2.5 is "gromit".</para>

  <para>Release 1.2.4 is yet another maintenance release for OpenNMS. It
  includes a few minor bug fixes, some new configurations, and a couple of
  small features.</para>

  <para>The code word for 1.2.4 is "wootness".</para>

  <para>Release 1.2.3 is another maintenance release in the OpenNMS stable
  branch. It addresses a polling issue that may cause polling to stop, as well
  as adding a final version of the poll-outages calendar. Also included are a
  number of new events and reports.</para>

  <para>The code word for 1.2.3 is "sith".</para>

  <para>Release 1.2.2 is 1.2.1 with one annoying webUI bug fixed.</para>

  <para>Release 1.2.1 is a maintenance release in the OpenNMS stable branch.
  It contains a few bug fixes and several small features. "Stable" releases
  may contain new features, as long as it is determined that they pose a very
  small risk to current features. Usually, these features will add new
  functionality without modifying existing feature behavior.</para>

  <para>The code word for 1.2.1 is "luckycharms".</para>

  <para>Release 1.2.0 is the first stable, or production, release of OpenNMS
  in a long time. It is basically 1.1.5 with numerous bug fixes. With the
  release of 1.2.0, we will begin development on 1.3 - the next unstable
  release.</para>

  <para>The code word for 1.2.0 is "valentine".</para>

  <para>Release 1.1.5 is the second release candidate for 1.2. The biggest
  change involves poller code that has been nearly rewritten. This was in
  response to a new feature concerning notifications, and while we believe it
  to be very robust, it does represent a lot of code churn, so if you are
  using 1.1.4 in production, you may wish to wait a bit before upgrading to
  1.1.5.</para>

  <para>Also, with this version of the release notes, we are implementing a
  "code word". We try to make these notes useful, including tips on the
  majority of issues people will face while using the application, but still
  people tend to skip reading them. So now, if you want to post a
  1.1.5-related question on the mailing lists, be sure to include the code
  word so people will know you have at least read this far into the release
  notes (grin).</para>

  <para>The code word for 1.1.5 is "monsoon".</para>

  <para>A quick summary of the new changes in 1.1.5, in no particular
  order:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>New notification behavior - users can configure OpenNMS to send
      notices when an event is auto-acknowledged by notifd and they will only
      be sent to those people who received notice of the outage in the first
      place.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>A new RADIUS poller</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>A number of new event definitions, including those from NetBotz,
      PATROL, Network Appliance and others.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Reorganized the <filename>datacollection-config.xml</filename> and
      <filename>snmp-graph.properties</filename> files to make them easier to
      manage. Also added a really cool CPU report for Net-SNMP agents.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>KSC Reports can now be accessed from the main page.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Removed the need for a primary SNMP interface (i.e. the ability to
      map an ifIndex to an IP Address in the ipAddrTable. This will help with
      data collection from some devices.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Added database support for the ifAlias field.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Added a MATCH-ANY-UEI event. Useful in notifications, this event
      will cause a notification on any UEI. Now, for example, all events from
      a particular IP Address or Node can be sent as notifications.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>There were also a large number of bug fixes and other small
  enhancements made to the code. Please test the heck out of this release and
  be sure to add issues to bugzilla (<ulink
  url="http://bugzilla.opennms.org">http://bugzilla.opennms.org</ulink>) and
  we'll get 1.2.0 out as soon as possible.</para>

  <para>Release 1.1.4 is the release candidate for 1.2 - the next stable
  branch of OpenNMS. It represents a tremendous amount of work in the areas of
  speed and performance. It incorporates many changes and bug fixes to make
  OpenNMS more Java centric - including a new installer. Current production
  users should note that this release contains a lot more changes to the
  underlying code than any release since 1.1.0, so if you are currently happy
  with 1.1.3 or an earlier version, you may want to wait a week or two before
  upgrading, or wait until 1.2.</para>

  <para>OpenNMS 1.1.3 is a major milestone on the way to the next stable
  release, 1.2. It contains a number of improvements, especially under the
  covers, and is the first release created under the new build system.</para>

  <para>OpenNMS 1.1.2 adds several new features and bug fixes. New features
  include a JDBC poller, a script-based poller and script-based event handler,
  as well as contributed support for a map.</para>

  <para>OpenNMS 1.1.1 is the next step towards the production 1.2 release. It
  contains a number of new features and bug fixes.</para>

  <para>OpenNMS 1.1 extends the work that was begun with 1.0 to make OpenNMS
  more powerful and easier to use. Almost all of the new functionality was
  suggested by current OpenNMS users. It is hoped that these improvements will
  prove useful, and will lead to even more suggestions on how to improve the
  product.</para>

  <para>OpenNMS 1.0.2 is a maintenance release that fixes several code
  issues.</para>

  <para>OpenNMS 1.0.1 is a maintenance release that fixes several code
  issues.</para>

  <para>Please, let us know if you have any problems at all at the <ulink
