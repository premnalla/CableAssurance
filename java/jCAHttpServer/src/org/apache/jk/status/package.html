<p>This package contains a set of <code>Task</code> implementations for
<em>Ant (version 1.6.x or later)</em> that can be used to interact with the
Apaache mod_jk status page to show, update, disable and stop mod_jk worker.
For more information, see

<p>The attributes of each task element correspond
exactly to the request parameters that are included with an HTTP request
sent directly to jk status page.  They are summarized as follows:
