	A "Server" is a singleton element that represents the entire JVM,
	which may contain one or more "Service" instances.  The Server
	listens for a shutdown command on the indicated port.
	
	Note:  A "Server" is not itself a "Container", so you may not
	define subcomponents such as "Valves" or "Loggers" at this level.
